1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,720
The great artisans say
the more the teapot is used

2
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,360
the more beautiful it becomes.

3
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:27,320
The pot is seasoned by repeatedly
pouring tea over the surface.

4
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:34,640
The deposit left on the clay creates
this beautiful patina over time.

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,080
Some pots, the clay has been
burnished by tea made over 400 years ago.

6
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,480
This museum will be
closing in 10 minutes.

7
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,520
400 years old, they're letting you
use it to make yourself a brew.

8
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,680
Some things aren't supposed
to sit behind glass,

9
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,360
they're made to be touched.

10
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,480
To be handled.

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,880
These pots need attention.

12
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,760
The clay is cracking.

13
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,200
Well, I can't see how a tiny splash
of tea is going to help.

14
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,000
Sometimes
you have to look hard at something

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,520
to see its value.

16
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,760
See?

17
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,960
This one shines a little brighter.

18
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,040
I don't suppose...

19
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,160
Um, I mean...

20
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,080
I don't suppose
that you want to have a drink?

21
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,400
Not tea, obviously.
Um, in a pub, with me, tonight.

22
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,480
Um...?

23
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,640
You wouldn't like me all that much.

24
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,040
Can I maybe decide that for myself?

25
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,000
I can't.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,720
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,720
Please stop asking.

28
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,760
Is that security?

29
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,240
Hello?

30
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,120
Can the till supervisor
please go to...?

31
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,800
Unexpected item in bagging area,

32
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,960
please try again.

33
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,960
Argh!

34
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,240
Item not scanned. Please try again.

35
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,920
Can you maybe keep your voice down?

36
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,480
Card not authorised.
Yes, all right! I've got it.

37
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,080
Please use an alternative method
of payment. Card not authorised.

38
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,080
Please use an alternative
method of payment.

39
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,640
Keep it. Keep that.

40
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,040
You took your time.
Yeah, I didn't get the shopping.

41
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,240
What? Why not?

42
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,880
Because I had a row in the shop
with a chip-and-PIN machine.

43
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,160
You...
You had a row with a machine?!

44
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,240
Sort of. It sat there and I
shouted abuse. Have you got cash?

45
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,680
Take my card.

46
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,160
You could always go yourself,
you know, you've been sitting there all morning,

47
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,600
you've not even moved since I left.

49
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,000
And what happened about that case
you were offered -

50
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,200
the Jaria diamond?
Not interested.

51
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,880
I sent them a message.
THUD!

52
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,680
Don't worry about me, I can manage.

53
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,080
Is that my computer?
Of course.

54
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,880
What?
Mine was in the bedroom.

55
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,840
What? And you couldn't
be bothered to get up?

56
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,400
It's password protected.

57
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,360
In a manner of speaking. Took me
less than a minute to guess yours,

58
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,440
not exactly Fort Knox.

59
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,920
Right. Thank you.

60
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,240
Oh...

61
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,080
Need to get a job.
Oh, dull.

62
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,840
Listen, um...

63
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,000
...if you'd be able to lend me some...

64
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,400
Sherlock, are you listening?
I need to go to the bank.

65
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,040
Yes, when you said
we were going to the bank...

66
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,960
Sherlock Holmes.

67
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,240
Sherlock Holmes.

68
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,920
Sebastian.
Hiya, buddy.

69
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,880
How long - eight years
since I last clapped eyes on you?

70
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,480
This is my friend, John Watson.
Friend? Colleague.

71
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,600
Right.

72
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,240
Grab a pew.

73
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,040
Do you need anything, coffee, water?

74
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,920
No? We're all sorted here, thanks.

75
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,440
So you're doing well.
You've been abroad a lot.

76
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,080
Well, so?

77
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,520
Flying all the way
around the world twice in a month.

78
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,800
Right. You're doing that thing.

79
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,600
We were at uni together, and this guy
here had a trick he used to do.

80
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,120
It's not a trick.

81
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,160
He could look at you
and tell you your whole life story.

82
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,600
Yes, I've seen him do it. Put the
wind up everybody, we hated him.

83
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,720
We'd come down to breakfast
in the formal hall

84
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,760
and this freak would know you'd been
shagging the previous night.

85
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,120
- I simply observed.
- Go on, enlighten me.

86
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,920
Two trips a month, flying all the way around
the world, you're quite right.

87
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,440
How could you tell? Are you going
to tell me there's a stain on my tie

88
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,920
from some special kind of ketchup
you can only buy in Manhattan?

89
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,400
No, I...
Is it the mud on my shoes?

90
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,400
I was just chatting with
your secretary outside.

91
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,960
She told me.

92
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,920
I'm glad you could make it over,
we've had a break-in.

93
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,960
Sir William's office -
the bank's former chairman.

94
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,840
The room's been left here
like a sort of memorial.

95
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,920
Someone broke in late last night.

96
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,480
What did they steal?
Nothing.

97
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,960
Just left a little message.

98
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,320
60 seconds apart.

99
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,240
So, someone came up here
in the middle of the night,

100
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,840
splashed paint around
and left within a minute.

101
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,640
How many ways into that office?

102
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,800
Well, that's where this gets
really interesting.

103
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,640
Every door that opens in this bank,
it gets locked right here.

104
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,600
Every walk-in cupboard, every toilet.

105
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,080
That door didn't open last night?

106
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,080
There's a hole in our security.

107
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,720
Find it and we'll pay you -

108
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,320
five figures.

109
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,080
This is an advance.

110
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,720
Tell me how he got in.

111
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,240
There's a bigger one on its way.

112
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,440
I don't need an incentive,
Sebastian.

113
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,000
He's, er...
...he's kidding you, obviously.

114
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,760
Shall I look after that for him?

115
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,240
Thanks.

116
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,440
Two trips around the world
this month.

117
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,560
You didn't ask his secretary,
you said that just to irritate him.

118
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,400
How did you know?
Did you see his watch?

119
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,160
His watch?

120
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,880
The time was right,
but the date was wrong.

121
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,240
Said two days ago. Crossed the date
line twice and he didn't alter it.

122
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,480
Within a month?
How did you get that? New Breitling.

123
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,920
Only came out this February.

124
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,640
OK. So do you think we should
sniff around here for a bit longer?

125
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,640
Got everything I need
to know already, thanks.

126
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,880
That graffiti was a message.

127
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,160
Someone at the bank,
working on the trading floors.

128
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,800
We find the intended recipient
and...

129
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
They'll lead us to the person
who sent it?

130
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Obvious.

131
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,920
Well, there's 300 people up there,
who was it meant for?

132
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,440
Pillars. What?

133
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,520
Pillars and the screens.

134
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,320
Very few places
you could see that graffiti from.

135
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,760
That narrows the field considerably.
And, of course, the message was left

136
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,040
at 11.34 last night.
That tells us a lot.

137
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,880
Does it?
Traders come to work at all hours.

138
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,640
Some trade with Hong Kong
in the middle of the night.

139
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,000
That message was intended for
somebody who came in at midnight.

140
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,760
Not many Van Coons
in the phone book.

141
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,800
Taxi!

142
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,640
So what do we do now? Sit here
and wait for him to come back?

143
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,600
Just moved in. What?

144
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,880
Floor above, new label.
Could have just replaced it.

145
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,000
No-one ever does that.
Hello?

146
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,680
Hi, um, I live in the flat just
below you. I don't think we've met.

147
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,280
No, well, er, I've just moved in.

148
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,440
Actually, I've just locked
my keys in my flat.

149
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,840
Do you want me to buzz you in?

150
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,360
Yeah. And can we use your balcony?

151
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,480
What?!

152
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,840
Sherlock?

153
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,800
Sherlock, are you OK?

154
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,960
Yeah, any time
you feel like letting me in!

155
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,400
Do you think he'd lost a lot of
money?

156
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,600
Suicide is pretty common
among City boys.

157
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,640
We don't know that it was suicide.
Come on.

158
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,760
The door was locked from the inside,
you had to climb down the balcony.

159
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,880
Been away three days
judging by the laundry.

160
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,200
Look at the case, there was
something tightly packed inside it.

161
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,040
Thanks. I'll take your word for it.
Problem?

162
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,680
Yeah, I'm not desperate to root
around some bloke's dirty underwear.

163
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,240
Those symbols at the bank, the
graffiti, why were they put there?

164
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,320
Some sort of code? Obviously.

165
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,720
Why were they painted? Want to
communicate, why not use e-mail?

166
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,320
Well, maybe he wasn't answering.

167
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,840
Oh, good, you follow.

168
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,680
No.

169
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,280
What kind of a message
would everyone try to avoid?

170
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,320
What about this morning?

171
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,800
Those letters you were looking at?
Bills?

172
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,880
Yes. He was being threatened.

173
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,520
Not by the Gas Board.

174
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,320
...see if we can get prints
off this glass.

175
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,280
Sergeant, we haven't met.

176
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,600
Yeah, I know who you are

177
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,000
and I would prefer it if you didn't
tamper with any of the evidence.

178
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,760
I phoned Lestrade. Is he on his way?
He's busy. I'm in charge.

179
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,600
And it's not Sergeant,
it's Detective Inspector Dimmock.

180
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,240
We're obviously
looking at a suicide.

181
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,840
It does seem the only explanation
of all the facts.

182
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,360
Wrong, it's one possible explanation
of some of the facts.

183
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,760
You've got a solution that you like,
but you are choosing

184
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,800
to ignore anything you see
that doesn't comply with it.

185
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,720
Like? Wound's on the right side of
his head.

186
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,000
And? Van Coon was left-handed.

187
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,440
Requires quite a bit of contortion.

188
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,080
Left-handed? I'm amazed you didn't notice.
All you have to do is look around this flat.

189
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,000
Coffee table on the left-hand side,

190
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,640
coffee mug handle
pointing to the left.

191
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,080
Power sockets, habitually used
the ones on the left. Pen and paper

192
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,400
on the left of the phone. Picked up with his right,
took messages with his left.

193
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,200
D'you want me to go on?
No, I think you've covered it.

194
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,960
I might as well, I'm almost
at the bottom of the list.

195
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,680
There's a knife on the breadboard
with butter on the right side of the blade

196
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,400
because he used it with his left.
It's highly unlikely

197
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,640
that a left-handed man would shoot
himself in the right of his head.

198
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,800
Conclusion, someone broke in here
and murdered him -

199
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,720
only explanation
of all of the facts.

200
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,800
But the gun?
He was waiting for the killer.

201
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,640
He'd been threatened. What?

202
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,520
Today at the bank, sort of a warning.

203
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,560
He fired a shot
when his attacker came in.

204
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,080
And the bullet?
Went through the open window.

205
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,000
Oh, come on!

206
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,760
What are the chances of that?!

207
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,000
Wait until you get the ballistics
report.

208
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,800
The bullet in his brain wasn't
fired from his gun, I guarantee it.

209
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,040
If his door was locked from the
inside, how did the killer get in?

210
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,920
Good, you're finally asking
the right questions.

211
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,240
He's left trying to sort of
cut his hair with a fork,

212
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,040
which of course can never be done.

213
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,920
It was a threat,
that's what the graffiti meant.

214
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,080
I'm kind of in a meeting.

215
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,440
Can you make an appointment
with my secretary?

216
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,680
I don't think this can wait.
Sorry, Sebastian.

217
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,680
One of your traders, someone who
worked in your office, was killed.

218
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,480
What? Van Coon.

219
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,560
The police are at his flat.

220
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,440
Killed?!
Sorry to interfere

221
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,640
with everyone's digestion.
Still want to make an appointment?

222
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,920
Would maybe nine o'clock
at Scotland Yard suit?

223
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,800
Harrow, Oxford...very bright guy.

224
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,840
Worked in Asia for a while, so...

225
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,520
You gave him the Hong Kong accounts?

226
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,760
Lost 5 million in a single morning,
made it all back a week later.

227
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,360
Nerves of steel, Eddie had.

228
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,760
Who'd want to kill him?
We all make enemies.

229
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,520
You don't all end up with a bullet
through your temple.

230
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,960
Not usually. Excuse me.

231
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,200
It's my chairman.

232
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,080
Police have been on to him.

233
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,000
Apparently they're telling him

234
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,880
it was a suicide.
Well, they've got it wrong,

235
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,080
Sebastian. He was murdered.

236
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,960
Well, I'm afraid
they don't see it like that.

237
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,200
So? And neither does my boss.

238
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,400
I hired you to do a job.
Don't get sidetracked.

239
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,320
I thought bankers were all supposed
to be heartless bastards.

240
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,320
I need you to get over to Crispians.

241
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,440
Two Ming vases up for auction -
Chenghua.

242
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,640
Will you appraise them? Soo Lin
should go - she's the expert.

243
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,240
Soo Lin has resigned her job.
I need you.

244
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,640
Just locum work.
No, that's fine.

245
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,840
You're, um...
Well, you're a bit over-qualified.

246
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,920
Er, I could always do
with the money.

247
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,440
Well, we've got two
away on holiday this week

248
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,920
and one's just left to have a baby.

249
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,680
It might be a bit mundane for you.

250
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,480
Er, no, mundane is good, sometimes.

251
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,080
Mundane works.

252
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,280
It says here you were a soldier.
And a doctor.

253
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,680
Anything else you can do?

254
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,720
I learned the clarinet at school.

255
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,360
Oh...
..well, I'll look forward to it.

256
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,120
I said, could you pass me a pen?

257
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,520
What? When?
About an hour ago.

258
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,440
Didn't notice I'd gone out then?

259
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,480
I went to see about a job
at that surgery.

260
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,400
How was it?
Great. She's great.

261
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,360
Who?

262
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,640
The job.

263
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,720
She?!

264
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,840
It.

265
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,160
Yeah, have a look.

266
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,400
"The intruder
who can walk through walls."

267
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,520
It happened last night.

268
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,800
Journalist shot dead in his flat.

269
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,680
Doors locked,
windows bolted from the inside.

270
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,440
Exactly the same as Van Coon.

271
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,480
God! You think...?
He's killed another one.

272
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,520
Brian Lukis,
freelance journalist,

273
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,880
murdered in his flat.

274
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,920
Doors locked from the inside.

275
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,080
You've got to admit,
it's similar.

276
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,400
Both men killed by someone
who can walk through solid walls.

277
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,120
Inspector, do you seriously believe
that Eddie Van Coon was

278
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,520
just another city suicide?

279
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,800
You have seen
the ballistics report, I suppose?

280
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,160
And the shot that killed him.
Was it fired from his own gun?

281
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,560
No. No.
So this investigation might move

282
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,200
a bit quicker if you were
to take my word as gospel.

283
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,840
I've just handed you
a murder inquiry.

284
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,040
Five minutes in his flat.

285
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,200
Four floors up.

286
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,960
That's why they think they're safe.

287
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,080
Put a chain across the door,
bolt it shut, think they're impregnable.

288
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,040
They don't reckon for one second
that there's another way in.

289
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,960
I don't understand. Dealing
with a killer who can climb.

290
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,200
What are you doing?
Clings to the walls like an insect.

291
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,280
CLUNK!
That's how he got in.

292
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,280
What?!

293
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,360
He climbed up the side of the walls,
ran along the roof,

294
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,320
dropped in through this skylight.

295
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,400
You're not serious?! Like Spider-Man?

296
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,720
He scaled six floors of a Docklands
apartment building,

297
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,240
jumped the balcony and killed
Van Coon. Oh, hold on!

298
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,720
That's how he got into the bank -
ran along the window ledge onto the terrace.

299
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,200
I have to find out
what connects these two men.

300
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,280
Date stamped on the book
is the same day that he died.

301
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,680
Sherlock?

302
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,520
So, the killer goes to the bank,

303
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,640
leaves a threatening cipher
at the bank.

304
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,400
Van Coon panics, returns
to his apartment, locks himself in.

305
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,440
Hours later, he dies.

306
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,320
The killer finds Lukis at the
library, he writes the cipher

307
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,920
on the shelf where he knows
it'll be seen. Lukis goes home.

308
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,120
Late that night, he dies too.

309
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,920
Why did they die, Sherlock?

310
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,920
Only the cipher can tell us.

311
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,160
The world's run on
codes and ciphers, John.

312
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,800
From the million-pound security
system at the bank to the PIN machine

313
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,000
you took exception to. Cryptography
inhabits our every waking moment.

314
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,560
Yes, OK, but...

315
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,320
But it's all computer generated -

316
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,840
electronic codes,
electronic ciphering methods.

317
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,640
This is different.

318
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,760
It's an ancient device.

319
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,120
Modern code-breaking methods
won't unravel it.

320
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,000
Where are we headed?
I need to ask some advice.

321
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,400
What?! Sorry?

322
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,920
You heard me perfectly.
I'm not saying it again.

323
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,640
You need advice?
On painting.

324
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,360
Yes, I need to talk to an expert.

325
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,120
Part of a new exhibition.

326
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,960
Interesting.
I call it...

327
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,400
Urban Bloodlust Frenzy.

328
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,280
Catchy!

329
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,080
I've got two minutes before
a Community Support Officer

330
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,360
comes around that corner.

331
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,920
Can we do this while I'm working?

332
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,240
Know the author?
I recognise the paint.

333
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,960
It's like Michigan...hard-core
propellant.

334
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,160
I'd say zinc.

335
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,680
And what about the symbols?
Do you recognise them?

336
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,840
I'm not even sure
it's a proper language.

337
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,120
Two men have been murdered, Raz.

338
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,240
Deciphering this is the key
to finding out who killed them.

339
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,160
And this is all you've
got to go on?

340
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,960
It's hardly much, is it?
Are you going to help us or not?

341
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,600
I'll ask around.

342
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,080
Somebody must know something
about it. Oi!

343
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,160
What the hell do you think you're
doing? This gallery is a listed public building.

344
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,520
No, no. Wait, wait.
It's not me who painted that.

345
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,000
I was just holding this for...

346
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,280
Bit of an enthusiast, are we?

347
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,560
She was right in the middle of
an important piece of restoration.

348
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,480
Why would she suddenly resign?

349
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,560
Family problems.
She said so in her letter.

350
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,560
But she doesn't have a family.
She came to this country on her own.

351
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,000
Andy! Look, those teapots,
those ceramics.

352
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,800
They've become her obsession.

353
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,280
She's been working on restoring them
for weeks.

354
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,760
I can't believe
that she would just...abandon them.

355
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,000
Perhaps she was getting
a bit of unwanted attention?

356
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,360
You've been a while.

357
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,800
Yeah, well, you know how it is.

358
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,840
Custody sergeants don't really
like to be hurried, do they?

359
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,360
Just formalities. Fingerprints,

360
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,960
charge sheet, and I've got to be
in magistrates' court on Tuesday.

361
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,040
What? Me, Sherlock!
In court, on Tuesday!

362
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,680
They're giving me an ASBO!
Good, fine.

363
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,040
You want to tell your little pal
he's welcome to go and own up any time.

364
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,280
This symbol, I still can't place it.

365
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,920
No, I need you to go
to the police station

366
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,120
and ask about the journalist.
The personal effects will have been impounded.

367
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,440
Get hold of his diary, or something
that will tell us his movements.

368
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,160
Go and see Van Coon's PA.

369
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,720
If you retrace their steps,
somewhere they'll coincide.

370
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,280
Scotland Yard.

371
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,280
Flew back from Dalian Friday.

372
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,120
Looks like he had back-to-back
meetings with the sales team.

373
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,600
Can you print me up a copy?

374
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,640
Sure.
What about the day he died?

375
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,680
Can you tell me where he was?
Sorry, I've got a gap.

376
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,520
I have all his receipts.

377
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,520
Your friend...
Listen, whatever you say,

378
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,120
I'm behind you 100 per cent.

379
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,600
...he's an arrogant sod.

380
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,000
Well, that was mild.
People say a lot worse than that.

381
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,520
This is what you wanted, isn't it?
The journalist's diary?

382
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,480
What kind of a boss was he, Amanda?
Appreciative?

383
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,040
Um, no. That's not a word I'd use.

384
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,800
The only things Eddie appreciated
had a big price tag.

385
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,520
Like that hand cream.
He bought that for you, didn't he?

386
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,600
Look at this one.

387
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,000
Got a taxi from him
on the day he died, £18.50.

388
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,840
That would get him to the office.

389
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,560
Not rush hour. Check the time.
Mid-morning. 18 would get him

390
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,920
as far as...The West End.
I remember him saying.

391
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,040
Underground,
printed at one in Piccadilly.

392
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,000
So he got a Tube back to the office.

393
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,400
Why would he get a taxi into town,
and then the Tube back?

394
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,640
Because he was delivering
something heavy.

395
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,520
You wouldn't lug a package
up the escalator.

396
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,440
Delivering?!

397
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,440
To somewhere near
Piccadilly Station.

398
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,760
Dropped the package,
delivered it, and then...

399
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,000
Stopped on his way. He got peckish.

400
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,600
So you bought your lunch
from here en route to the station

401
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,240
but where were you headed from?

402
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,160
Where did the taxi drop you?

403
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,880
Oof! Right.

404
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,840
Eddie Van Coon brought a package
here the day he died.

405
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,320
Whatever was hidden inside
that case...

406
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,280
I've managed to piece
together a picture

407
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,800
using scraps of information -
credit card bills, receipts. He flew back from China,

408
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,320
then he came here. Sherlock.

409
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,680
Somewhere in this street, somewhere
near. I don't know where, but...

410
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,800
That shop, over there.
How could you tell?

411
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,160
Lukis' diary. He was here too.

412
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,360
He wrote down the address. Oh.

413
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,360
Hello.

414
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,800
You want...lucky cat?

415
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,440
No, thanks, no.

416
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,200
£10! £10!

417
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,480
I think your wife, she will like.

418
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,480
Um, thank you.

419
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,640
Sherlock...

420
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,800
The label there.
Yes, I see it.

421
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,400
It's exactly the same as the cipher.

422
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,120
It's an ancient number system -
Hang Zhou.

423
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,480
These days only street traders
use it.

424
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,640
Those were numbers written on the
wall at the bank and at the library.

425
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,720
Numbers written in
an ancient Chinese dialect.

426
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,400
It's a 15.

427
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,520
What we thought was the
artist's tag, it's a number 15.

428
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:50,480
And the blindfold, the horizontal
line. That was a number as well.

429
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,880
The Chinese number one, John.
We found it.

430
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,800
Two men travel back from China,

431
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,440
both head straight for
the Lucky Cat emporium.

432
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,640
What did they see?

433
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,720
It's not what they saw.

434
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,080
It's what they both brought back
in those suitcases.

435
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,240
And you don't mean duty free.

436
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,600
Thank you.

437
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,000
Think about what Sebastian told us.

438
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,720
About Van Coon, about
how he stayed afloat in the market.

439
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,640
Lost 5 million.
Made it back in a week.

440
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,480
That's how he made such easy money.

441
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,240
He was a smuggler. Mm.

442
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,040
Cover would have been perfect.

443
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,360
Businessman,
making frequent trips to Asia.

444
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,560
Lukis was the same,
a journalist writing about China.

445
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,000
Both of them smuggled stuff about.

446
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,280
The Lucky Cat was their drop-off.

447
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,440
But why did they die?

448
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,120
It doesn't make sense. If they both
turn up at the shop and deliver the goods,

449
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,800
why would someone threaten them

450
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,040
and kill them after the event,
after they'd finished the job?

451
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,160
What if one of them
was light-fingered?

452
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,120
How do you mean? Stole something.

453
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,640
Something from the hoard.

454
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,640
The killer doesn't know
which of them took it

455
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,120
so threatens them both. Right.

456
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,720
Remind me.

457
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,320
When was the last time
that it rained?

458
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,160
It's been here since Monday.

459
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,920
No-one's been in that flat
for at least three days.

460
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,960
Could have gone on holiday.

461
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,760
Do you leave your windows open
when you go on holiday?

462
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,520
Sherlock!

463
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,840
Someone else has been here.

464
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:16,480
Somebody else broke into the flat
and knocked over the vase, just like I did.

465
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,520
Do you think maybe
you could let me in this time?

466
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,720
Can you not keep doing this, please?

467
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,880
I'm not the first.

468
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,920
What?
Somebody's been in here before me.

469
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,520
What are you saying?

470
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,040
Size eight feet.

471
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,800
Small, but...athletic.

472
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,600
I'm wasting my breath.

473
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,600
Small, strong hands.

474
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,440
Our acrobat.

475
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,360
Why didn't he close the window
when he lef...?

476
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,280
Oh, stupid, stupid!

477
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,280
Obvious.

478
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,880
He's still here.

479
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,520
Any time you want to include me...

480
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,320
John...

481
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,440
John!

482
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,160
Oh, I'm Sherlock Holmes
and I always work alone

483
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,160
because no-one else can compete
with my massive intellect!

484
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,880
The milk's gone off
and the washing's started to smell.

485
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,760
Somebody left here in a hurry
three days ago. Somebody?

486
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,480
Soo Lin Yao. We have to find her.

487
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,200
How, exactly?

488
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,080
We could start with this.

489
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,080
You've gone all croaky.
Are you getting a cold?

490
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,720
I'm fine.

491
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,440
When was the last time
that you saw her?

492
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,960
Three days ago.
Here at the museum.

493
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,920
This morning they told me
she'd resigned.

494
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,480
Just like that.
Left her work unfinished.

495
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,360
What was the last thing that she did
on her final afternoon?

496
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,680
She does this demonstration
for the tourists, a tea ceremony.

497
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:37,280
So she would have packed up her
things and just put them in here.

498
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,480
We have to get to Soo Lin Yao.

499
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,800
If she's still alive.
Sherlock!

500
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,440
Oh, look who it is.

501
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,880
Found something you'll like.

502
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,240
Tuesday morning,

503
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,360
all you've got to do is turn up
and say the bag was yours.

504
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,960
Forget about your court date.

505
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,480
Dude, that was rad!

506
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,960
You want to hide a tree, then a
forest is the best place to do it,

507
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,640
wouldn't you say?

508
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,320
People would just walk
straight past, not knowing,

509
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,120
unable to decipher the message.

510
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,400
There. I spotted it earlier.

511
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,280
They've been here.
And that's the exact same paint?

512
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,280
Yeah.

513
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,520
John, if we're going to
decipher this code,

514
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,200
we need to look for more evidence.

515
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,080
Answer your phone.
I've been calling you.

516
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,840
PANTING
I found it.

517
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,600
It's been painted over.

518
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,320
I don't understand. It was...

519
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,440
here.

520
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,000
10 minutes ago. I saw it.

521
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,760
A whole load of graffiti.

522
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,840
Somebody doesn't want me to see it.

523
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,120
Sherlock, what are you doing...?
Ssh! John, concentrate.

524
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,960
I need you to concentrate.
Close your eyes.

525
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,480
What? Why? Why? What are you doing?

526
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,160
I need you to maximise
your visual memory.

527
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,120
Try to picture what you saw.

528
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,240
Can you picture it? Yeah.

529
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,000
Can you remember it?
Yes, definitely.

530
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,080
Can you remember the pattern?

531
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,800
Yes. How much can you remember it?

532
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,960
Look, don't worry.

533
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,400
Because the average human memory
on visual matters is only 62% accurate.

534
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,680
Well, don't worry,
I remember all of it. Really?

535
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,120
At least I would, if I could get
to my pockets. I took a photograph.

536
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,120
Always in pairs, John, look.

537
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,840
Numbers...

538
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,720
come with partners.

539
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,120
God, I need to sleep.

540
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,240
Why did he paint it
so near the tracks? No idea.

541
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,320
Thousands of people
pass by there every day.

542
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,320
Just 20 minutes...

543
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,320
Of course.

544
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,640
Of course, he wants information.
He's trying to communicate

545
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,880
with his people in the underworld.
Whatever was stolen, he wants it back.

546
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,520
It's somewhere here, in a code.

547
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,800
We can't crack this
without Soo Lin Yao.

548
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,760
Oh, good.

549
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,520
Two men who travelled back
from China were murdered.

550
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,640
And their killer left them messages
in Hang Zhou numerals.

551
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,640
Soo Lin Yao is in danger.

552
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,520
That cipher, it was just
the same pattern as the others.

553
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,280
He means to kill her as well.

554
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,200
Look, I've tried everywhere -

555
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,800
friends, colleagues.
I don't know where she's gone.

556
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,120
I mean, she could be
a thousand miles away.

557
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,280
What are you looking at?
Tell me more about those teapots.

558
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,800
The pots were her obsession.
They need urgent work.

559
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,160
If they dry out,
then the clay can start to crumble.

560
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,280
Apparently, you have to just
keep making tea in them.

561
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,120
Yesterday, only one of those pots
was shining.

562
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,840
Now, there are two.

563
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,960
Fancy a biscuit with that?

564
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,960
Centuries old.
Don't want to break that.

565
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,480
Hello.

566
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,280
You saw the cipher.

567
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,880
Then you know he is coming for me.

568
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,440
You've been clever
to avoid him so far.

569
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,680
I had to finish.

570
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,560
To finish this work.

571
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,640
It's only a matter of time.

572
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,200
I know he will find me.

573
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,120
Who is he?
Have you met him before?

574
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,200
When I was a girl, we met in China.

575
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,640
I recognised his...

576
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,000
signature.
The cipher?

577
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,200
Only he would do this. Zhi Zhu.

578
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,760
Zhi Zhu? The spider.

579
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,360
You know this mark?

580
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,480
Yes. It's the mark of a Tong.

581
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,080
Huh? Ancient crime syndicate,
based in China.

582
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,080
Every foot soldier bears the mark.

583
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,400
Everyone who hauls for them.

584
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,320
Hauls?

585
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,840
You mean you were a smuggler?

586
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,840
I was 15.

587
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,440
My parents were dead.

588
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,480
I had no livelihood.

589
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,200
No way of surviving, day-to-day,

590
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,200
except to work for the bosses.

591
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,000
Who are they?

592
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,040
They are called the Black Lotus.

593
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,400
By the time I was 16,

594
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,560
I was taking
thousands of pounds worth of drugs

595
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,480
across the border into Hong Kong.

596
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,360
I managed to leave
that life behind me.

597
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,160
I came to England.

598
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,080
They gave me a job, here.

599
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,920
Everything was good. New life.

600
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,720
And he came looking for you.

601
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,200
Yes.

602
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,440
I hoped, after five years...

603
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,560
maybe they would have forgotten me.

604
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,440
But they never really let you leave.

605
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,040
A small community like ours...

606
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,560
..they are never very far away.

607
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,640
He came to my flat.

608
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:26,280
He asked me to help him to track down
something that was stolen.

609
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,200
And you've no idea what it was?

610
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,480
I refused to help.

611
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,800
So, you knew him well
when you were living back in China?

612
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,560
Oh, yes.

613
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,200
He's my brother.

614
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,360
Two orphans.

615
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,240
We had no choice.

616
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:09,600
We could work for the Black Lotus,
or starve on the streets, like beggars.

617
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,720
My brother has become their puppet.

618
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:22,400
In the power of the one
they call Shan.

619
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,160
The Black Lotus general.

620
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,800
I turned my brother away.

621
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,520
He said I had betrayed him.

622
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,480
Next day, I came to work

623
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,880
and the cipher was waiting.

624
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,080
Can you decipher these?

625
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,520
These are numbers. Yes, I know.

626
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:59,840
Here, the line across the man's
eyes, it's the Chinese number one.

627
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,600
And this one is 15.
But what's the code?

628
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,160
All the smugglers know it.

629
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,840
It's based upon a book...

630
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,320
He's here.

631
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,840
Zhi Zhu has found me.

632
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,120
No, no, Sherlock.

633
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,160
Sherlock, wait!

634
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,000
Come here.

635
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,960
Get in. Get in!

636
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,320
I have to go and help him.
Bolt the door after me.

637
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,200
Careful!

638
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:22,560
Some of those skulls are over
200,000 years old. Have a bit of respect.

639
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,400
Thank you.

640
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,400
Liang.

641
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,040
Oh, my God.

642
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,120
How many murders is it going to take

643
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,840
before you start believing
that this maniac's out there?

644
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,960
A young girl was gunned down
tonight.

645
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,800
That's three victims in three days.
You're supposed to be finding him.

646
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,160
Brian Lukis and Eddie Van Coon

647
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,520
were working for a gang
of international smugglers.

648
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:36,080
A gang called the Black Lotus,
operating here in London

649
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,320
right under your nose.

650
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,720
Can you prove that?

651
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,320
What are you thinking?
Pork or pasta? Oh, it's you.

652
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,360
I suppose it's never going
to trouble Egon Ronay, is it?

653
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,920
I'd stick with the pasta.

654
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,200
Don't want to be doing roast pork,
not if you're slicing up cadavers.

655
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,560
What are you having?

656
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,000
I don't eat when I'm working.
Digesting slows me down.

657
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,880
So you're working here tonight?

658
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,720
Need to examine some bodies. Some?

659
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,520
Eddie Van Coon and Brian Lukis.

660
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,080
They're on my list.

661
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,960
Could you wheel them out again
for me?

662
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:22,200
Well...their paperwork's
already gone through.

663
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,960
You changed your hair. What?

664
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,560
The style.
It's usually parted in the middle.

665
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,160
Yes, well...

666
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,400
It's good.

667
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,800
It...suits you better this way.

668
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,520
We're just interested in the feet.

669
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,320
The feet? Yes.

670
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,120
Do you mind if we have
a look at them?

671
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,480
Now, Van Coon.

672
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,800
Oh! So...

673
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,120
So either these two men just happened
to visit the same Chinese tattoo parlour,

674
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:18,560
or I'm telling the truth.
What do you want?

675
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:21,080
I want every book from Lukis'
apartment and Van Coon's.

676
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,320
Their books?

677
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,240
Not just a criminal organisation.
It's a cult.

678
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,720
Her brother was corrupted
by one of its leaders.

679
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,160
Soo Lin said the name.

680
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,920
Yes, Shan. General Shan.

681
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,600
We're still no closer to finding him.

682
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,920
Wrong! We've got almost
all we need to know.

683
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,000
She gave us most of
the missing pieces.

684
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,600
Why did he need to visit his sister?

685
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,160
Why did he need her expertise?
She worked at the museum.

686
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,360
Exactly. An expert in antiquities.

687
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,920
Of course, I see.
Valuable antiquities, John.

688
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,760
Ancient Chinese relics
purchased on the black market.

689
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,000
China's home to a thousand treasures
hidden after Mao's revolution.

690
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,440
The Black Lotus is selling them.

691
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,960
Check for the dates... Here,

692
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,600
John,
"arrived from China four days ago".

693
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,160
Anonymous.

694
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,640
The vendor doesn't give his name.

695
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,120
"Two undiscovered treasures
from the East."

696
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:26,640
One in Lukis' suitcase
and one in Van Coon's.

697
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,120
"Antiquities...

698
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:31,920
"sold at auction."

699
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,280
Look, here's another one.

700
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,000
Arrived from China a month ago,

701
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,440
Chinese ceramic statue sold for
£400,000.

702
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,840
Look, a month before that,
Chinese painting, £500,000.

703
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,160
All of them
from an anonymous source.

704
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:49,120
They're stealing them back in China
and one by one feeding them into Britain.

705
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,560
Every single auction coincides
with Lukis or Van Coon travelling to China.

706
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,720
So what if one of them got greedy
when they were in China?

707
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,280
What if one of them stole something?

708
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,600
That's why Zhi Zhu's come.

709
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,760
Sorry, are we collecting
for charity, Sherlock?

710
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:06,920
What?

711
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,800
A young man's outside
with crates of books.

712
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,360
So the numbers are references.

713
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,760
To books.

714
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:22,160
To specific pages
and specific words on those pages.

715
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,440
Right, so...

716
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,560
15 and 1, that means?

717
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,760
Turn to page 15
and it's the first word you read.

718
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,160
OK, so what's the message?
Depends on the book.

719
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,080
That's the cunning of the book code.

720
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,040
It has to be one that they both own.

721
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:43,840
OK, fine. This shouldn't take
too long, should it?

722
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,600
We found these...at the museum.
Is this your writing?

723
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:04,200
Er, we hoped Soo Lin
could decipher it for us.

724
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,160
Ta.

725
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,720
Anything else I can do?

726
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,880
To assist you, I mean.

727
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,240
Some silence right now
would be marvellous.

728
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,280
Cigarette.

729
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,280
Imagine.

730
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,160
Oh...

731
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,680
I'm sorry to keep you waiting,

732
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,480
but we haven't got anything now
until next Thursday.

733
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,320
This is taking ages.

734
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,680
Sorry.

735
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,040
What's the point of booking
an appointment if they can't stick to it?

736
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,680
Um, what's going on?

737
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:39,840
That new doctor you hired, he
hasn't buzzed the intercom for ages.

738
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,600
Let me go and have a word.

739
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,440
Excuse me. Sorry.

740
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,960
John?

741
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,240
John?

742
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,560
Looks like I'm done.
I thought I had some more to see.

743
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,640
Oh, I did one or two of yours.
One or two?

744
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,920
Well, maybe five or six.

745
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,280
I'm sorry,
that's not very professional.

746
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,920
No, not really.

747
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,400
I had...a bit of a late one.

748
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,160
Oh, right.

749
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,600
Anyway, see you.

750
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:31,480
So...what were you doing
to keep you up so late?

751
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,440
I was attending
a sort of book event.

752
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:38,600
Oh. Oh, she likes books,
does she, your girlfriend?

753
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,480
No, it wasn't a date.

754
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:44,480
Good. I mean, I'm...
And I don't have one tonight.

755
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,400
A book that everybody would own.

756
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,280
15, entry 1.

757
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,560
I need to get some air.
We're going out tonight.

758
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,680
Actually, I've got a date. What?

759
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,840
Where two people who like each other
go out and have fun?

760
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,480
That's what I was suggesting.

761
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,480
No, it wasn't. At least, I hope not.

762
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,080
Where are you taking her?

763
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,640
Er, cinema.

764
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,640
Dull, boring, predictable...

765
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,920
Why don't you try this?

766
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,800
In London for one night only.

767
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,320
LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

768
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,440
Thanks, but I don't come to you
for dating advice.

769
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,640
It's years since anyone
took me to the circus.

770
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,880
Right, yes.

771
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:51,000
A friend recommended it to me
and I phoned up.

772
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,080
Oh! What are they,
a touring company or something?

773
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,800
I don't know much about it.

774
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,680
I think they're probably from China.

775
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:01,040
I think so, yes.
There's a coincidence!

776
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,440
That's wonderful,
thank you very much.

777
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,600
Hi, I have two tickets
reserved for tonight.

778
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,800
And what's the name? Holmes.

779
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,560
Actually, I have three in that name.

780
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,080
No, I don't think so,
we only booked two.

781
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:21,640
Then I phoned back
and got one for myself as well.

782
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,720
I'm Sherlock.

783
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,600
Hi. Hello.

784
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,600
You couldn't let me have
just one night off.

785
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:37,120
Yellow Dragon Circus,
in London for one day. It fits.

786
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,840
The Tong sent an assassin
to England...

787
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,120
Dressed as a tightrope walker.
Come on, Sherlock, behave!

788
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,200
We're looking for a killer who can
climb, who can shin up a rope.

789
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,920
Where else would you find
that level of dexterity?

790
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,200
Exit visas are scarce in China.

791
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,120
They need a good reason
to get out of that country.

792
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,920
All I need to do
is have a quick look around...

793
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,720
Fine. You do that,
I'll take Sarah for a pint.

794
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,000
I need your help.

795
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,760
I do have a couple of other things
on my mind this evening.

796
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:59,000
Like what?

797
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,040
You are kidding?
What's so important?

798
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,880
Sherlock,
I'm in the middle of a date.

799
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,880
You're going to chase some killer
while I'm trying to...

800
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,960
What?

801
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,080
While I'm trying to get off
with Sarah.

802
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:12,720
Hey... Ready?

803
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,200
Yeah.

804
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,640
You said circus.
This is not a circus.

805
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,080
Look at the size of this crowd.

806
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,560
Sherlock, this is...art.

807
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:33,160
This is not their day job.

808
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:37,640
Sorry, I forgot, they're not a circus,
they're a gang of international smugglers.

809
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:12,840
Classic Chinese escapology act.

810
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:16,040
Hm?
The crossbow's on a delicate string.

811
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:19,320
The warrior has to escape his bonds
before it fires.

812
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,200
She splits the sandbag,
the sand pours out.

813
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:00,080
Gradually,
the weight lowers into the bowl.

814
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,880
Thank God. My God!

815
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,800
Ladies and gentlemen.

816
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:20,440
From the distant moonlit shores
of the Yangtze River,

817
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:23,520
we present, for your pleasure,

818
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:27,800
the deadly Chinese bird spider.

819
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,240
Did you see that?

820
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,280
Well, well.

821
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,520
Found you.

822
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,760
Come on.
Come on. Let's go!

823
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:45,640
I sent a couple of cars.
The old hall is totally deserted.

824
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:49,000
Look, I saw the mark at the circus.
The tattoo that we saw

825
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,840
on the two bodies,
the mark of the Tong.

826
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:54,360
Lukis and Van Coon were part of
a smuggling operation.

827
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:56,880
One of them stole something
in China. Something valuable.

828
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,040
The circus performers
were gang members

829
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:00,200
sent here to get it back.
Get what back?

830
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,120
We don't know.

831
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,800
You don't know?

832
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:09,840
Mr Holmes,
I've done everything you asked.

833
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:13,640
Lestrade, he seems to think
your advice is worth something.

834
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:14,920
I gave the order for a raid.

835
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,120
Please tell me I'll have something
to show for it.

836
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,960
Other than a massive bill
for overtime.

837
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,240
They'll be back in China by tomorrow.

838
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:28,920
No, they won't leave
without what they came for.

839
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,840
We need to find a hideout.

840
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,360
A rendezvous.

841
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,640
Somewhere in this message
it must tell us.

842
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,120
Well, I think
perhaps I should leave you to it.

843
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:46,600
No, you don't have to go. Stay.
Yes, it'd be better if you left now.

844
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:50,160
He's kidding.
Please stay if you'd like.

845
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,200
Is it just me
or is anyone else starving?

846
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,640
Oh, God.

847
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,120
So this is what you do.

848
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,960
You and John,
you solve puzzles for a living.

849
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:14,400
Consulting detective.

850
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,440
Oh.

851
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,040
Oh!

852
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,360
What are these squiggles?

853
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,360
They're numbers.
An ancient Chinese dialect.

854
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:31,680
Oh, right. Well, of course
I should have known that.

855
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:40,760
I've done punch
and a bowl of nibbles.

856
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,680
Mrs Hudson, you are a saint.

857
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:45,080
If it was Monday,
I'd have been to the supermarket.

858
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,640
Thank you. Thank you.

859
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,480
SIRENS PASS BY

860
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:56,400
So these numbers, it's a cipher?
Exactly.

861
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,800
And each pair of numbers is a word?

862
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:00,800
How did you know that?

863
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,520
Well, two words
have already been translated. Here.

864
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,320
John. Mmm?

865
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,320
John, look at this.

866
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:14,760
Soo Lin at the museum, she started
to translate the code for us.

867
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,440
We didn't see it.

868
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,520
Nine mill.

869
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:21,960
Does that mean millions?

870
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:25,000
Nine million quid. For what?

871
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,120
We need to know
the end of this sentence.

872
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,680
Where are you going?

873
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:33,480
To the museum, to the restoration
room. We must have been staring right at it. At what?

874
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:36,400
The book, John. The book.
The key to cracking the cipher.

875
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:39,520
Soo Lin used it to do this. Whilst
we were running around the gallery,

876
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:43,040
she started to translate the code.
It must be on her desk.

877
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,200
Taxi!

878
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,640
ANGRY VOICE

879
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,320
Entschuldigen Sie, bitte.

880
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,320
Ja, danke!

881
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:17,280
A book that everybody would own.

882
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:22,080
Please, wait!

883
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,760
Bitte!

884
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,840
Was wollt er?

885
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,480
Hey, du, was machst du?

886
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,680
Minute!
Gib mir doch mein Buch zuruck!

887
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,000
Yeah. No, absolutely.

888
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,040
I mean, a quiet night in
is just what the doctor ordered.

889
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:45,960
I mean, I love to go out of an evening
and wrestle a few Chinese gangsters generally,

890
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,080
but a girl can get too much. OK.

891
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:54,360
Er, shall we get a takeaway?

892
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:55,920
Yeah.

893
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,120
Page 15, entry 1...

894
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,200
Page 15, entry 1.

895
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:06,240
Dead man.

896
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:08,960
You were threatening to kill them.

897
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,680
That's the first cipher.

898
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,400
9... 0... 15...

899
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,840
er, 15 and 36.

900
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:22,040
36, 39, 39...

901
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:23,800
39...

902
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,280
9...

903
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:33,160
"Nine", "mill", "for"...

904
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,200
Blimey, that was quick.
I'll just pop down.

905
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,840
Do you want me to lay the table?

906
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:51,920
Um...eat off trays? Yeah.

907
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,720
70...35...

908
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,360
Jade...

909
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,320
Jade.

910
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,840
Sorry to keep you.
How much do you want?

911
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,520
Do you have it? What?

912
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:13,080
Do you have the treasure?
I don't understand.

913
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:30,720
"Nine mill for Jade pin.

914
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,680
"Dragon den, black...

915
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:35,160
"tramway."

916
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,600
John! John, I've got it.

917
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:51,480
The cipher, the book. It's the
London A-Z that they're us...

918
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:12,560
A book is like
a magic garden,

919
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,960
carried in your pocket.

920
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:32,920
Chinese proverb, Mr Holmes.
I'm...

921
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,480
I'm not Sherlock Holmes.

922
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:38,000
Forgive me
if I do not take your word for it.

923
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,480
Ow!

924
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,680
Debit card, name of...

925
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:46,840
S Holmes.

926
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:47,960
Take my card.

927
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,080
Yes, that's not actually mine.
He lent that to me.

928
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:57,040
And a cheque for £5,000 made out
in the name of Mr Sherlock Holmes.

929
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:00,480
Yeah, he gave me that to look after.

930
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:04,480
Tickets from the theatre
collected by you, name of Holmes.

931
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:05,720
Yes, OK.

932
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,160
What's the name?
Er, Holmes.

933
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,000
I realise what this looks like.

934
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,640
But I'm not him.

935
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:14,280
We heard it from your own mouth.
What?

936
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:18,360
"I am Sherlock Holmes
and I always work alone."

937
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:21,400
Because no-one else can compete with
my massive intellect.

938
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,560
Did I really say that?

939
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:31,720
I suppose there's no use me trying
to persuade you I was doing an impression.

940
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,200
I am Shan.

941
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,960
You're... You're Shan?

942
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:43,360
Three times we tried to kill you
and your companion, Mr Holmes.

943
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:47,000
What does it tell you when an
assassin cannot shoot straight?

944
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,320
It tells you
that they're not really trying.

945
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,720
Tramway.

946
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,840
There.

947
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:34,120
Not blank bullets now. OK.

948
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:37,160
If we wanted to kill you, Mr Holmes,
we would have done it by now.

949
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,960
We just wanted to
make you inquisitive.

950
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,840
Do you have it?
Do I have what?

951
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:48,360
The treasure. I don't know
what you're talking about.

952
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:51,440
I would prefer to make certain.

953
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:59,080
Everything in the West
has its price.

954
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:03,960
And the price for her life -
information.

955
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:13,280
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

956
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:30,520
Where's the hairpin? What?

957
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:34,440
The Empress pin
valued at £9 million sterling?

958
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,720
We already had a buyer in the West

959
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,960
and then one of our people
was greedy, he took it,

960
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:42,240
brought it back to London, and you,
Mr Holmes, have been searching.

961
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:45,520
Please, please. Listen to me.
I'm not...

962
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,840
I'm not Sherlock Holmes.
You have to believe me.

963
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,680
I haven't found whatever it is
you're looking for.

964
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:54,800
I need a volunteer from
the audience. No, please, please!

965
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,320
Ah, thank you, lady.

966
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:01,480
Yes, you'll do very nicely.

967
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:29,960
Ladies and gentlemen, from the
distant, moonlit shores of NW1,

968
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:33,640
we present for your pleasure,

969
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:39,680
Sherlock Holmes' pretty companion
in a death-defying act. Please!

970
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:47,520
You've seen the act before.
How dull for you.

971
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,080
You know how it ends.

972
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,000
I'm not Sherlock Holmes!

973
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,520
I don't believe you.

974
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,440
You should, you know.

975
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:57,480
Sherlock Holmes
is nothing at all like him.

976
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:01,040
How would you describe me, John?

977
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:04,920
Resourceful? Dynamic? Enigmatic?
Late?

978
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:06,480
That's a semi-automatic.
If you fire it,

979
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,320
the bullet will travel at
over 1,000 metres per second.

980
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:10,840
Well?

981
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:13,200
Well...

982
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,400
..the radius curvature of these
walls is nearly four metres.

983
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,680
If you miss,
the bullet will ricochet.

984
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,360
Could hit anyone.

985
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:21,280
Might even bounce off the tunnel
and hit you.

986
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,920
It's all right.

987
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,400
You're going to be all right.
It's over now.

988
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,000
Don't worry.

989
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,040
Next date won't be like this.

990
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,480
We'll just slip off. No need
to mention us in your report.

991
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:17,600
Mr Holmes... I have high hopes
for you, Inspector.

992
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,920
A glittering career.

993
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,960
I go where you point me.

994
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,480
Exactly.

995
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,680
Ta.

996
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:36,440
So, nine million. Million.

997
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:41,800
Million, yes. Nine million for
Jade pin dragon den black tramway.

998
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:44,280
An instruction
to all their London operatives.

999
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:46,960
A message.
What they were trying to reclaim.

1000
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,800
What, a jade pin?
Worth £9 million.

1001
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:51,120
Bring it to the Tramway,
their London hideout.

1002
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,720
Hang on. A hairpin worth £9 million?

1003
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:55,960
Apparently. Why so much?

1004
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:58,120
Depends who owned it.

1005
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,080
Two operatives based in London.

1006
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,960
They travel over to Dalian
to smuggle those vases.

1007
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,320
One of them helps himself
to something, a little hairpin.

1008
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,800
Worth £9 million.
Eddie Van Coon was the thief,

1009
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,800
he stole the treasure
when he was in China.

1010
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,480
How do you know it was Van Coon,
not Lukis?

1011
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,560
Even the killer didn't know that.
Because of the soap.

1012
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,080
Amanda?
He brought you a present.

1013
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,560
Oh, hello.

1014
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:40,240
A little gift
when he came back from China.

1015
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:44,640
How do you know that?
You weren't just his PA, were you?

1016
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:46,240
Someone's been gossiping.

1017
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:48,080
No. Then I don't understand why...

1018
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,040
Scented hand soap in his apartment.

1019
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:53,480
300ml of it. Bottle almost finished.

1020
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:58,480
Sorry...? I don't think Eddie Van Coon was the type
of chap to buy himself hand soap,

1021
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,600
not unless he had
a lady coming over.

1022
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,200
And it's the same brand as that
hand cream there on your desk.

1023
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:08,840
Look, it wasn't serious between us.

1024
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:13,440
It was over in a flash,
it couldn't last. He was my boss.

1025
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:16,040
What happened? Why did you end it?

1026
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:21,040
I thought he didn't appreciate me.

1027
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,840
Took me for granted.

1028
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,160
Stood me up once too often.

1029
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:29,960
We'd plan to go away for the weekend,
and then he'd just leave.

1030
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:32,720
Fly off to China
at a moment's notice.

1031
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:34,960
And he brought you a present
from abroad to say sorry.

1032
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:39,680
Can I just have a look at it?

1033
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,640
He really climbed up
onto the balcony?

1034
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:51,720
Nail a plank across the window
and all your problems are over.

1035
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:55,640
Thanks.

1036
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:59,080
He said he bought it
in a street market.

1037
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:02,000
Oh, I don't think that's true.
I think he pinched it.

1038
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,520
Yeah, that's Eddie.

1039
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,960
Didn't know its value,
just thought it would suit you.

1040
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:08,880
Oh? What's it worth?

1041
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:13,080
£9 million.

1042
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,320
Oh, my God.

1043
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:18,880
Oh, my God!

1044
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:23,000
Nine million?!

1045
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:37,680
Over 1,000 years old

1046
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:39,840
and it's sitting on her bedside table
every night.

1047
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,880
He didn't know its value. Didn't
know why they were chasing him.

1048
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:47,120
Should've just got her a lucky cat.

1049
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,520
You mind, don't you? What?

1050
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:56,480
That she escaped. General Shan.

1051
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,440
It's not enough
that we got her two henchmen.

1052
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,240
Must be a vast network, John.

1053
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:02,000
Thousands of operatives.

1054
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,520
You and I,
we barely scratched the surface.

1055
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,640
You cracked the code though,
Sherlock.

1056
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:09,480
And maybe Dimmock can track down
all of them now he knows it.

1057
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:13,920
No. No, I crack this code,

1058
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:18,000
all the smugglers have to do
is pick up another book.

1059
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:46,080
Without you...

1060
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:49,080
without your assistance,

1061
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:52,360
we would not have found
passage into London.

1062
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,800
You have my thanks.

1063
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,640
We did not anticipate...

1064
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:15,240
We did not know this man would come.

1065
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:19,760
This Sherlock Holmes.

1066
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:26,840
And now your safety is compromised.

1067
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:39,240
I will not reveal your identity.
