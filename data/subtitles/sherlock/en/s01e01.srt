1
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,240
How's your blog going?

2
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,599
Yeah, good, very good.

3
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,279
You haven't written a word, have you?

4
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,119
You just wrote
"Still has trust issues".

5
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,160
And you read my writing upside down.

6
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,799
You see what I mean?

7
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,720
John, you're a soldier,

8
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,359
and it's going to take you
a while to adjust to civilian life.

9
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,200
And writing a blog about everything
that happens to you will honestly help you.

10
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,680
Nothing happens to me.

11
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,840
Sherlock 1x1
A Study in Pink
Original Air Date on July 25, 2010

12
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,679
- What do you mean there's no ruddy car?
- He went to Waterloo, I'm sorry.

13
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,360
- Get a cab.
- I never get cabs!

14
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,199
- I love you.
- When?

15
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,400
Get a cab!

16
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,999
My husband

17
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,199
was a happy man
who lived life to the full.

18
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,519
He loved his family and his work,

19
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,039
and that he should have
taken his own life in this way

20
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,079
is a mystery

21
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,400
and a shock to all who knew him.

22
00:03:46,117 --> 00:03:48,200
Taxi, taxi!

23
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,159
- I'll be just two minutes, mate.
- What?

24
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,199
- I'm just going home to get my umbrella.
- You can share mine.

25
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,640
Two minutes, all right?

26
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,439
She still dancing?

27
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,239
Yeah, if you can call it that.

28
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,319
- Did you get the car keys off her?
- Got them out of her bag.

29
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,960
Where is she?

30
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,279
The body of Beth Davenport,
Junior Minister for Transport,

31
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,919
was found late last night
on a building site in Greater London.

32
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,559
Preliminary investigations
suggest that this was suicide.

33
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,519
We can confirm that this apparent
suicide closely resembles those of

34
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,279
Sir Jeffrey Patterson
and James Phillimore.

35
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,919
In the light of this, these incidents
are now being treated as linked.

36
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,919
The investigation is ongoing but Detective
Inspector Lestrade will take questions now.

37
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,279
Detective Inspector,
how can suicides be linked?

38
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,399
Well, they all took the same poison.

39
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,599
They were all found in places
they had no reason to be.

40
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,759
- None of them had shown any prior indication.
- But you can't have serial suicides.

41
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,439
Well, apparently you can.

42
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,479
These three people,
there's nothing that links them?

43
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,999
There's no link we've found yet but...

44
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,240
We're looking for it.
There has to be one.

45
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,559
- If you've all got texts, please ignore them.
- It just says "Wrong".

46
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,959
Well, just ignore that.
If there are no more questions,

47
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,599
I'm going to bring
this session to an end.

48
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,279
If they're suicides,
what are you investigating?

49
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,599
As I say, these suicides
are clearly linked.

50
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,280
It's an unusual situation, we've
got our best people investigating.

51
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,159
Says "Wrong" again.

52
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,359
One more question. Is there any
chance that these are murders?

53
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,119
And if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

54
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,959
I know that you like writing about these
but these do appear to be suicides.

55
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,999
We know the difference. The poison
was clearly self-administered.

56
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,039
Yes, but if they are murders,
how do people keep themselves safe?

57
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,599
Well, don't commit suicide.

58
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,959
Daily Mail!

59
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:48,839
Obviously, this is a frightening time for people but all
anyone has to do is exercise reasonable precautions.

60
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,719
We are all as safe as we want to be.

61
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,680
Thank you.

62
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,799
You've got to stop him doing that.
He's making us look like idiots.

63
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,360
If you can tell me
how he does it, I'll stop him.

64
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,439
John!

65
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,080
John Watson!

66
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,839
- Stamford, Mike Stamford. We were at Barts together.
- Yes, sorry, yes, Mike, hello.

67
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,319
- Yes, I know, I got fat.
- No, no.

68
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,119
I heard you were abroad somewhere
getting shot at. What happened?

69
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,600
I got shot.

70
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,599
Are you still at Barts, then?

71
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,879
Teaching now, yeah, bright
young things like we used to be.

72
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,959
God, I hate them.

73
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,679
What about you, just staying in
town till you get yourself sorted?

74
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,439
I can't afford London
on an Army pension.

75
00:07:56,452 --> 00:07:57,955
And you couldn't bear
to be anywhere else.

76
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,160
- That's not the John Watson I know.
- I'm not the John Watson.

77
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,559
Couldn't Harry help?

78
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,639
Yeah, like that's going to happen!

79
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,679
I don't know,
get a flatshare or something?

80
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,360
Come on.
Who'd want me for a flatmate?

81
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,479
What?

82
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,919
You're the second person
to say that to me today.

83
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,280
Who was the first?

84
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,839
How fresh?

85
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,719
Just in. 67, natural causes.

86
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,879
Used to work here.
I knew him, he was nice.

87
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,119
Fine.

88
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,280
We'll start with the riding crop.

89
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,080
So, bad day, was it?

90
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,199
I need to know what bruises form in the next
twenty minutes. A man's alibi depends on it. Text me.

91
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,519
Listen, I was wondering.
Maybe later, when you're finished...

92
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,599
You're wearing lipstick.
You weren't wearing lipstick before.

93
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,559
I refreshed it a bit.

94
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,079
Sorry, you were saying?

95
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,879
I was wondering
if you'd like to have coffee?

96
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,600
Black, two sugars, please.
I'll be upstairs.

97
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,160
Okay...

98
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,279
- Bit different from my day.
- You've no idea!

99
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,479
Mike, can I borrow your phone?
There's no signal on mine.

100
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,359
- And what's wrong with the landline?
- I prefer to text.

101
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,520
Sorry, it's in my coat.

102
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,280
Here, use mine.

103
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,799
Oh, thank you.

104
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,920
This is an old friend of mine,
John Watson.

105
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,320
Afghanistan or Iraq?

106
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,520
- Sorry?
- Which was it, in Afghanistan or Iraq?

107
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,839
Afghanistan, sorry,
how did you know?

108
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,959
Ah, Molly! Coffee, thank you.

109
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,519
What happened to the lipstick?

110
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,359
It wasn't working for me.

111
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,559
Really? It was a big improvement.
Your mouth's too small now.

112
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,120
Okay.

113
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,760
How do you feel about the violin?

114
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,519
I'm sorry, what?

115
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,479
I play the violin when I'm thinking and sometimes
I don't talk for days on end. Would that bother you?

116
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,680
Potential flatmates should know
the worst about each other.

117
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,479
- You told him about me?
- Not a word.

118
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,359
Who said anything about flatmates?

119
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,679
I did. Told Mike this morning that I must be
a difficult man to find a flatmate for.

120
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,919
Now here he is just after lunch with
an old friend clearly just home from

121
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,759
military service in Afghanistan.
Wasn't a difficult leap.

122
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,199
How did you know about Afghanistan?

123
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,439
Got my eye on a nice little place
in central London.

124
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,119
Together we ought to be able to afford it.

125
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,199
We'll meet there tomorrow
evening, seven o'clock.

126
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,119
Sorry, got to dash. I think I left
my riding crop in the mortuary.

127
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,679
Is that it?

128
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,639
Is that what?

129
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,359
We've only just met and we're
going to go and look at a flat?

130
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,120
Problem?

131
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,199
We don't know
a thing about each other.

132
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,719
I don't know where we're meeting,
I don't even know your name.

133
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,759
I know you're an Army doctor and you've
been invalided home from Afghanistan.

134
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,879
You've got a brother worried about you
but you won't go to him for help because you don't

135
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,519
approve of him, possibly because he's an alcoholic,
more likely because he recently walked out on his wife.

136
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:35,079
And I know that your therapist thinks your
limp's psychosomatic. Quite correctly, I'm afraid.

137
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,560
That's enough to be going
on with, don't you think?

138
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,759
The name's Sherlock Holmes,
and the address is 221B Baker Street.

139
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,280
Afternoon.

140
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,960
Yeah, he's always like that.

141
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,199
Hello.

142
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,240
- Ah... Mr. Holmes.
- Sherlock, please.

143
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,599
Well, this is a prime spot.
Must be expensive.

144
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,599
Mrs. Hudson, the landlady...
she's given me a special deal.

145
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,359
Owes me a favour. A few years back, her husband
got himself sentenced to death in Florida.

146
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,279
- I was able to help out.
- Sorry... You stopped her husband being executed?

147
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,840
Oh, no, I ensured it.

148
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,479
Sherlock!

149
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,039
Mrs. Hudson, Dr. John Watson.

150
00:13:24,061 --> 00:13:25,857
- Hello. Come in.
- Thank you.

151
00:13:25,881 --> 00:13:27,040
Shall we...?

152
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,720
Well, this could be very nice.

153
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,079
Very nice indeed.

154
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,439
Yes.

155
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,959
Yes, I think so,
my thoughts precisely.

156
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:08,839
- So I went straight ahead and moved in.
- Soon as we get all this rubbish cleaned out...

157
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:14,039
- Oh. So this is all...
- Well, obviously I can erm... straighten things up a bit.

158
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,119
- That's a skull.
- Friend of mine.

159
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,759
When I say friend...

160
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,839
What do you think, then, Dr. Watson?

161
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,839
There's another bedroom upstairs,
if you'll be needing two bedrooms.

162
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,839
Of course we'll be needing two.

163
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:33,680
Oh, don't worry, there's all sorts round here.
Mrs. Turner next door's got married ones.

164
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,520
Oh... Sherlock!
The mess you've made.

165
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,720
I looked you up on
the internet last night.

166
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,199
- Anything interesting?
- Found your website. The Science of Deduction.

167
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,520
What did you think?

168
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,439
You said you could identify a software designer
by his tie and an airline pilot by his left thumb?

169
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,719
Yes.

170
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,359
And I can read your military career
in your face and your leg,

171
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,439
and your brother's drinking habits
on your mobile phone.

172
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,560
How?

173
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,639
What about these suicides then, Sherlock?
I thought that'd be right up your street.

174
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,159
Three, exactly the same.

175
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,400
Four.

176
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:23,441
There's been a fourth.

177
00:15:23,453 --> 00:15:25,960
- And there's something different this time.
- A fourth?

178
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,639
- Where?
- Brixton, Lauriston Gardens.

179
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,479
What's new about this one? You wouldn't have
come to me if there wasn't something different.

180
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,136
- You know how they never leave notes?
- Yeah.

181
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,146
This one did.

182
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,119
Will you come?

183
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,000
- Who's on forensics?
- Anderson.

184
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,679
He doesn't work well with me.

185
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,319
- Well, he won't be your assistant.
- I need an assistant.

186
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,920
- Will you come?
- Not in a police car, I'll be right behind.

187
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,720
Thank you.

188
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,320
Brilliant! Yes!

189
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,599
Four serial suicides, and now a note.

190
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,759
Oh, it's Christmas. Mrs. Hudson,
I'll be late. Might need some food.

191
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,519
I'm your landlady, dear,
not your housekeeper.

192
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,119
Something cold will do. John, have
a cup of tea, make yourself at home.

193
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,879
Don't wait up!

194
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,399
Look at him, dashing about...

195
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:26,439
My husband was just the same.
But you're more the sitting-down type, I can tell.

196
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,599
I'll make you that cuppa,
you rest your leg.

197
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,199
Damn my leg! Sorry, I'm so sorry...

198
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,119
It's just sometimes
this bloody thing...

199
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,959
I understand, dear, I've got a hip.

200
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,959
- Cup of tea'd be lovely. Thank you.
- Just this once, dear, I'm not your housekeeper.

201
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,720
- Couple of biscuits too, if you've got 'em.
- Not your housekeeper!

202
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,880
You're a doctor.

203
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,600
In fact you're an Army doctor.

204
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,959
Yes.

205
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,440
Any good?

206
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,480
Very good.

207
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,279
Seen a lot of injuries, then.
Violent deaths.

208
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,319
Well, yes.

209
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,919
Bit of trouble too, I bet?

210
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,200
Of course. Yes.
Enough for a lifetime, far too much.

211
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,200
- Want to see some more?
- Oh, God, yes.

212
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,040
- Sorry Mrs. Hudson, I'll skip the tea. Off out.
- Both of you?

213
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,359
Impossible suicides? Four of them?

214
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,519
No point sitting at home when there's
finally something fun going on!

215
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,919
- Look at you, all happy. It's not decent.
- Who cares about decent?

216
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,320
The game, Mrs. Hudson, is on!

217
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,440
Taxi!

218
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,719
Okay, you've got questions...

219
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,759
Yeah, where are we going?

220
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,199
Crime scene. Next?

221
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,359
- Who are you, what do you do?
- What do you think?

222
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,959
- I'd say... private detective.
- But?

223
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,880
But the police don't go
to private detectives.

224
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,599
I'm a consulting detective. Only
one in the world, I invented the job.

225
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,421
- What does that mean?
- Means when the police are out of their depth,

226
00:18:39,443 --> 00:18:42,977
- which is always, they consult me.
- The police don't consult amateurs.

227
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,719
When I met you for the first time yesterday,
I said Afghanistan or Iraq. You looked surprised.

228
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,799
- Yes, how did you know?
- I didn't know, I saw.

229
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,719
Your haircut, the way
you hold yourself says military.

230
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,199
- But your conversation as you entered...
- Bit different from my day.

231
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,120
...said trained at Barts.
So Army doctor, obvious.

232
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,879
Your face is tanned...

233
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,279
but no tan above the wrists. You've
been abroad, but not sunbathing.

234
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,359
Your limp's really bad when you walk,
but you don't ask for a chair when you stand,

235
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,359
like you'd forgotten about it.
So it's at least partly psychosomatic.

236
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,519
That says the original circumstances
of the injury were traumatic...

237
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,439
Wounded in action then. Wounded in
action, suntan... Afghanistan or Iraq.

238
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,159
You said I had a therapist.

239
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,279
You've got a psychosomatic limp,
of course you've got a therapist.

240
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,159
Then there's your brother.
Your phone.

241
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,199
It's expensive,
e-mail enabled, MP3 player.

242
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,439
And you're looking for a flatshare.
You wouldn't buy this. It's a gift, then.

243
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,679
Scratches.
Not one, many over time...

244
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,639
it's been in the same pocket
as keys and coins.

245
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,839
You wouldn't treat
your one luxury item like this,

246
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,959
so it's had a previous owner.
Next bit's easy. You know it already.

247
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,519
The engraving?

248
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,559
Harry Watson. Clearly a family
member who's given you his old phone.

249
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,799
Not your father,
this is a young man's gadget.

250
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,839
Could be a cousin, but you're a war
hero who can't find a place to live...

251
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,799
Unlikely you've got an extended family,
not one you're close to. So brother it is.

252
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,719
Now, who's Clara? Three kisses
says it's a romantic attachment.

253
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,119
The expense of the phone
says wife, not girlfriend.

254
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,679
Must have given it to him recently,
this model's only six months old.

255
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,359
Marriage in trouble then...
six months on he's given it away.

256
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,639
If she'd left him,
he would have kept it. Sentiment.

257
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,519
No, he wanted rid of it. He left her.

258
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,959
He gave the phone to you, that says
he wants you to stay in touch.

259
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,119
You're looking for cheap accommodation,
but you're not going to your brother for help...

260
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,719
that says you've got problems with him.
Maybe you liked his wife, or don't like his drinking.

261
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,799
How can you possibly know
about the drinking?

262
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,919
Shot in the dark. Good one, though.

263
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,199
Power connection...
Tiny little scuff marks round it.

264
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,719
Every night he plugs it in to charge
but his hands are shaking.

265
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,978
You never see those marks on a sober man's phone,
never see a drunk's without them.

266
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,159
- There you go, see? You were right.
- I was right? Right about what?

267
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,440
The police don't consult amateurs.

268
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,920
That... was amazing.

269
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,279
- Do you think so?
- Of course it was. It was extraordinary, quite extraordinary.

270
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,159
- That's not what people normally say.
- What do people normally say?

271
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,640
"Piss off!"

272
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,120
Did I get anything wrong?

273
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,039
Harry and me don't get on,
never have,

274
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,199
Clara and Harry split up
three months ago

275
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,279
and they're getting a divorce,

276
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,759
and Harry is a drinker.

277
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,519
Spot on, then. I didn't expect
to be right about everything.

278
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,480
Harry's short for Harriet.

279
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,778
- Harry's your sister.
- Look, what exactly am I supposed to be doing here?

280
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:36,138
- Sister!
- No, seriously, what am I doing here?

281
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,699
There's always something.

282
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,319
- Hello, freak!
- I'm here to see Detective Inspector Lestrade.

283
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,839
Why?

284
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,039
I was invited.

285
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,039
- Why?
- I think he wants me to take a look.

286
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,559
- Well, you know what I think, don't you?
- Always, Sally.

287
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,639
I even know you didn't
make it home last night.

288
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,479
- I don't... Who's this?
- Colleague of mine, Dr. Watson.

289
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,279
Dr. Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan.

290
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,839
Old friend.

291
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,519
A colleague.
How do you get a colleague?

292
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,839
Did he follow you home?

293
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,400
- Would it be better if I just waited...
- No.

294
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,520
Freak's here. Bringing him in.

295
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,159
Ah, Anderson. Here we are again.

296
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:25,079
It's a crime scene. I don't want it
contaminated. Are we clear on that?

297
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,199
Quite clear.

298
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,079
And is your wife away for long?

299
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,759
Oh, don't pretend you worked
that out. Somebody told you that.

300
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,159
Your deodorant told me that.

301
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,279
My deodorant?

302
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,079
- It's for men.
- Well, of course it's for men... I'm wearing it.

303
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,320
So's Sergeant Donovan.

304
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,719
Ooh... I think it just vaporised.
May I go in?

305
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,239
Whatever you're trying to imply...

306
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:51,079
I'm not implying anything. I'm sure Sally came
round for a nice little chat, and just happened to stay over.

307
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,760
And I assume she scrubbed your floors,
going by the state of her knees.

308
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,519
You'll need to wear one of these.

309
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,959
Who's this?

310
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,519
He's with me.

311
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,160
- But who is he?
- I said he's with me.

312
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,440
Aren't you going to put one on?

313
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,160
- So where are we?
- Upstairs.

314
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,759
I can give you two minutes.

315
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,079
May need longer.

316
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,759
Her name's Jennifer Wilson
according to her credit cards,

317
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,439
we're running them now
for contact details.

318
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,199
Hasn't been here long.

319
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,800
Some kids found her.

320
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,199
Shut up.

321
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,680
- I didn't say anything.
- You were thinking. It's annoying.

322
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,159
Got anything?

323
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,159
Not much.

324
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,359
She's German.

325
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,919
Rache. It's German for revenge.
She could be trying to tell us something...

326
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,879
Yes, thank you for your input.

327
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,159
- So she's German?
- Of course she's not. She's from out of town though.

328
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,879
Intended to stay in London
for one night

329
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,039
before returning home to Cardiff.
So far, so obvious.

330
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,079
Sorry... Obvious?
What about the message though?

331
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,559
Dr. Watson, what do you think?

332
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,919
- Of the message?
- Of the body. You're a medical man.

333
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,519
We have a whole team right outside.

334
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,599
They won't work with me. I'm breaking
every rule letting you in here...

335
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,000
Yes... because you need me.

336
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,359
Yes, I do.

337
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,639
God help me.

338
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,400
- Dr. Watson!
- Hm?

339
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,160
Oh, do as he says. Help yourself.

340
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,040
Anderson, keep everyone out
for a couple of minutes...

341
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,359
- Well?
- What am I doing here?

342
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,194
- Helping me make a point.
- I'm supposed to be helping you pay the rent.

343
00:26:29,205 --> 00:26:32,399
- This is more fun.
- Fun? There's a woman lying dead.

344
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,920
Perfectly sound analysis,
but I was hoping you'd go deeper.

345
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,199
Yeah...

346
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,799
Asphyxiation, probably.
Passed out, choked on her own vomit.

347
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,519
Can't smell any alcohol on her.

348
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,719
It could have been a seizure.
Possibly drugs.

349
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,639
You know what it was,
you've read the papers.

350
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,879
Well, she's one of the suicides.
The fourth...?

351
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,879
Sherlock, two minutes, I said,
I need anything you got.

352
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,479
Victim is in her late thirties.
Professional person, going by her clothes...

353
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,759
I'm guessing the media, going by
the frankly alarming shade of pink.

354
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,079
Travelled from Cardiff today intending to stay
in London one night from the size of her suitcase.

355
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,901
- Suitcase?
- Yes. She's been married at least ten years,

356
00:27:24,912 --> 00:27:28,479
but not happily. She's had a string of lovers but
none of them knew she was married.

357
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,759
Oh, for God's sake,
if you're just making this up...

358
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,319
Her wedding ring.
Ten years old at least.

359
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,981
The rest of her jewellery has been
regularly cleaned, but not her wedding ring.

360
00:27:36,992 --> 00:27:40,280
State of her marriage, right there.
The inside is shinier than the outside.

361
00:27:40,304 --> 00:27:43,119
The only polishing it gets
is when she works it off her finger.

362
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,519
It's not for work, look at her nails. She doesn't work
with her hands, so who does she remove her rings for?

363
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,239
Clearly not one lover, she'd never sustain
the fiction of being single for that amount of time

364
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,200
- so more likely a string of them.
- Brilliant.

365
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,639
- Sorry.
- Cardiff?

366
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,880
- It's obvious, isn't it?
- It's not obvious to me.

367
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,159
Dear God, what is it like in your funny little brains,
it must be so boring. Her coat...

368
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,879
it's slightly damp, she's been
in heavy rain the last few hours...

369
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,599
no rain anywhere in London
in that time.

370
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,239
Under her coat collar is damp too.
She's turned it up against the wind.

371
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,799
She's got an umbrella in her pocket
but it's dry and unused.

372
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,359
Not just wind, strong wind...
too strong to use her umbrella.

373
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,279
We know from her suitcase that
she was intending to stay overnight

374
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,639
but she can't have travelled more than two
or three hours because her coat still hasn't dried.

375
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,799
So... where has there been heavy rain and
strong wind within the radius of that travel time?

376
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,119
Cardiff.

377
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,439
- Fantastic.
- Do you know you do that out loud?

378
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,079
- Sorry, I'll shut up.
- No, it's... fine.

379
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,119
- Why do you keep saying suitcase?
- Yes, where is it?

380
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,159
She must have had a phone or an organiser.
Find out who Rachel is. She was writing Rachel?

381
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,839
No, she was leaving an angry note in German!
Of course she was writing Rachel, no other word it can be.

382
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,759
- Why did she wait until she was dying to write it?
- How do you know she had a suitcase?

383
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,799
Tiny splash marks on her right heel
and calf not present on the left.

384
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,359
She was dragging a wheeled suitcase
behind her with her right hand,
by that splash pattern.

385
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,519
Smallish case, going by the spread.

386
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,279
Case that size,
woman this clothes-conscious...

387
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,239
could only be an overnight bag
so we know she was staying one night.

388
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,679
Where is it,
what have you done with it?

389
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,520
There wasn't a case.

390
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,519
- Say that again.
- There wasn't a case. There was never any suitcase.

391
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,999
Suitcase! Did anyone find a suitcase?
Was there a suitcase in this house?

392
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,599
Sir, there was no case!

393
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,359
But they take the poison themselves,
swallow the pills.

394
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,920
- There are clear signs, even you lot couldn't miss them.
- Right, thanks. And...?

395
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,039
It's murder, all of them.
I don't know how.

396
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,399
But they're not suicides,
they're serial killings.

397
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,759
We've got a serial killer, love those.
There's always something to look forward to.

398
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,799
- Why are you saying that?
- Her case! Come on, where is her case?

399
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,759
Did she eat it? Someone else
was here, and they took her case.

400
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,879
So the killer must have driven here.
Forgot the case was in the car.

401
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,079
She could have checked into a hotel,
left it there.

402
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:55,159
No, look at her hair. She colour-coordinates
her lipstick and her shoes.

403
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,919
She'd never have left any hotel
with her hair still looking...

404
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,400
Oh...

405
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,839
Oh!

406
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,479
Sherlock? What is it, what?

407
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,199
Serial killers, always hard.
You have to wait for them to make a mistake.

408
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,359
- We can't just wait!
- Oh, we're done waiting. Look at her, really look!

409
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,639
Houston, we have a mistake.
Get on to Cardiff.

410
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,759
Find out who Jennifer Wilson's
family and friends were. Find Rachel!

411
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,640
Of course, yeah... but what mistake?!

412
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,760
Pink!

413
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,600
Let's get on with it...

414
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,719
- He's gone.
- Who, Sherlock Holmes?

415
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,999
Yeah, he just took off.
He does that.

416
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,080
- Is he coming back?
- Didn't look like it.

417
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,040
Right.

418
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,760
Right...

419
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,720
Yes.
Sorry, where am I?

420
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,320
Brixton.

421
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,199
Do you know where I could get a cab?

422
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,439
It's just er...

423
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,079
Well...

424
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,759
My leg.

425
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,600
Er...

426
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,719
Try the main road.

427
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,879
Thanks.

428
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,439
But you're not his friend.

429
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,400
He doesn't have friends.

430
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,559
So who are you?

431
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,439
I'm... I'm nobody. I just met him.

432
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,439
Okay, bit of advice then.
Stay away from that guy.

433
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,440
Why?

434
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,560
You know why he's here?

435
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,839
He's not paid or anything.

436
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,160
He likes it. He gets off on it.

437
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,599
The weirder the crime, the more
he gets off. And you know what...?

438
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,759
One day just showing up
won't be enough.

439
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,039
One day we'll be standing round a body
and he'll be the one that put it there.

440
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,119
- Why would he do that?
- Because he's a psychopath.

441
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,680
Psychopaths get bored.

442
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,640
- Donovan!
- Coming.

443
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,120
Stay away from Sherlock Holmes.

444
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,720
Taxi! Taxi...

445
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,359
Hello?

446
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,879
There is a security camera
on the building to your left.

447
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,360
Do you see it?

448
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,800
Who's this?

449
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,119
Who's speaking?

450
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,080
Do you see the camera,
Dr. Watson?

451
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,400
- Yeah, I see it.
- Watch...

452
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,319
There is another camera on the
building opposite you. Do you see it?

453
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,400
Mm-hm.

454
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,599
And finally, at the top of
the building on your right.

455
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,159
How are you doing this?

456
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,319
Get into the car, Dr. Watson.

457
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,840
I would make some sort of threat,
but I'm sure your situation is quite clear to you.

458
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,840
- Hello.
- Hi.

459
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,119
What's your name, then?

460
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,840
Er... Anthea.

461
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,680
- Is that your real name?
- No.

462
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,279
I'm John.

463
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,960
Yes. I know.

464
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,360
Any point in asking...
where I'm going?

465
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,239
None at all...

466
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,520
John.

467
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,240
Okay.

468
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,040
Have a seat, John.

469
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,440
You know, I've got a phone.

470
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,479
I mean, very clever and all that,

471
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,559
but, er...

472
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,240
you could just phone me.

473
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,680
On my phone.

474
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:05,479
When one is avoiding the attention of Sherlock Holmes,
one learns to be discreet, hence this place.

475
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,280
Your leg must be hurting you.
Sit down.

476
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,760
I don't want to sit down.

477
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,199
You don't seem very afraid.

478
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,879
You don't seem very frightening.

479
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,519
Yes...

480
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,479
The bravery of the soldier.

481
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,039
Bravery is by far the kindest
word for stupidity, don't you think?

482
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,520
What is your connection
to Sherlock Holmes?

483
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:33,159
I don't have one. I barely know him,
I met him... yesterday.

484
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:37,479
Mmm, and since yesterday you've moved in
with him and now you're solving crimes together.

485
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,759
Might we expect a happy announcement
by the end of the week?

486
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,279
- Who are you?
- An interested party.

487
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,239
Interested in Sherlock? Why?

488
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,319
I'm guessing you're not friends.

489
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,720
You've met him. How many friends
do you imagine he has?

490
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,547
I am the closest thing to a friend
that Sherlock Holmes is capable of having.

491
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,707
- And what's that?
- An enemy.

492
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:59,919
- An enemy?
- In his mind, certainly.

493
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,559
If you were to ask him,
he'd probably say his arch-enemy.

494
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,439
He does love to be dramatic.

495
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,760
Well, thank God
you're above all that.

496
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,040
I hope I'm not distracting you.

497
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,439
Not distracting me at all.

498
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,559
Do you plan to continue your
association with Sherlock Holmes?

499
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,839
I could be wrong...

500
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,359
but I think that's
none of your business.

501
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,080
- It could be.
- It really couldn't.

502
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,000
If you do move into, erm...

503
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,039
221B Baker Street,

504
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,279
I'd be happy to

505
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,999
pay you a meaningful sum of money
on a regular basis to ease your way.

506
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,319
Why?

507
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,959
Because you're not a wealthy man.

508
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,560
In exchange for what?

509
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,279
Information.

510
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,759
Nothing indiscreet. Nothing
you'd feel... uncomfortable with.

511
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,520
- Just tell me what he's up to.
- Why?

512
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,999
I worry about him. Constantly.

513
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,679
That's nice of you.

514
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,119
But I would prefer for various reasons
that my concern go unmentioned,

515
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:12,359
we have what you might call a...
difficult relationship.

516
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,199
- No.
- But I haven't mentioned a figure.

517
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,919
Don't bother.

518
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,959
You're very loyal very quickly.

519
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,760
No, I'm not,
I'm just not interested.

520
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,640
"Trust issues"... it says here.

521
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,519
What's that?

522
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,519
Could it be that you've decided to
trust Sherlock Holmes of all people?

523
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,479
- Who says I trust him?
- You don't seem the kind to make friends easily.

524
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,280
Are we done?

525
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,320
You tell me.

526
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,559
I imagine people have already
warned you to stay away from him,

527
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,760
but I can see from your left hand
that's not going to happen.

528
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,360
- My what?
- Show me.

529
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,280
Don't...

530
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,799
- Remarkable.
- What is?

531
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:38,479
Most people... blunder round this city,
and all they see are streets and shops and cars.

532
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,319
When you walk with Sherlock
Holmes, you see the battlefield.

533
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,719
You've seen it already. Haven't you?

534
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,879
What's wrong with my hand?

535
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,479
You have an intermittent tremor
in your left hand.

536
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,559
Your therapist thinks it's
post-traumatic stress disorder.

537
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,479
She thinks you're haunted by
memories of your military service.

538
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,000
Who the hell are you?

539
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,279
- How do you know that?
- Fire her. She's got it the wrong way round.

540
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,960
You're under stress right now
and your hand is perfectly steady.

541
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,640
You're not haunted by the war,
Dr. Watson...

542
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,120
You miss it.

543
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,600
Welcome back.

544
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,480
Time to choose a side, Dr. Watson.

545
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,320
I'm to take you home.

546
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,199
Address?

547
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,359
Er, Baker Street.

548
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,080
221B Baker Street.

549
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,600
But I need to stop off
somewhere first.

550
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:29,079
Listen, your boss. Any chance you could
not tell him this is where I went?

551
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,639
- Sure.
- You've told him already, haven't you?

552
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,080
Yeah.

553
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,639
Hey erm...
do you ever get any free time?

554
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,920
Oh, yeah. Lots.

555
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,720
- Bye...
- Okay.

556
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,560
What are you doing?

557
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,160
Nicotine patch.

558
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,599
Helps me think.

559
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,359
Impossible to sustain a smoking
habit in London these days.

560
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,119
Bad news for brain work.

561
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,159
- It's good news for breathing.
- Oh... Breathing! Breathing's boring.

562
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,959
Is that... three patches?

563
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,760
It's a three-patch problem.

564
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,120
Well...?

565
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,080
You asked me to come,
I'm assuming it's important.

566
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,240
Oh... yeah, of course.
Can I borrow your phone?

567
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,059
- My phone?
- Don't want to use mine.

568
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:55,096
Always a chance my number will
be recognised. It's on the website.

569
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,079
- Mrs. Hudson's got a phone.
- Yeah, she's downstairs.

570
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,199
- I tried shouting but she didn't hear.
- I was the other side of London...

571
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,000
There was no hurry.

572
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,440
Here...

573
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,319
So what's this about... the case?

574
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,527
- Her case...
- Her case?

575
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:17,735
Her suitcase, yes, obviously.

576
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,239
The murderer took her suitcase,
first big mistake.

577
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,879
Okay, he took her case. So?

578
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,080
It's no use, there's no other way.
We'll have to risk it.

579
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,600
On my desk there's a number.
I want you to send a text.

580
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,559
You've brought me here...
to send a text.

581
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,080
Text, yes. The number on my desk.

582
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,879
- What's wrong?
- Just met a friend of yours.

583
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,839
- A friend?
- An enemy.

584
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,320
Oh. Which one?

585
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,520
Well, your arch-enemy, according to
him. Do people have arch-enemies?

586
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,240
Did he offer you money to spy on me?

587
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,119
- Yes.
- Did you take it?

588
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,831
- No.
- Pity, we could have split the fee.

589
00:44:07,855 --> 00:44:09,123
Think it through next time.

590
00:44:10,555 --> 00:44:11,225
Who is he?

591
00:44:11,236 --> 00:44:14,439
The most dangerous man you've ever
met, and not my problem right now.

592
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,080
On my desk, the number!

593
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,319
Jennifer Wilson. That was...

594
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,519
Hang on. Wasn't that the dead woman?

595
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,399
Yes. That's not important.
Just enter the number.

596
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,011
- Are you doing it?
- Yes.

597
00:44:32,012 --> 00:44:32,822
Have you done it?

598
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,279
Yeah, hang on!

599
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,919
These words exactly.

600
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,359
"What happened at Lauriston Gardens?

601
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,159
"I must have blacked out.

602
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,279
"22 Northumberland Street,

603
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,839
- please come."
- You blacked out?

604
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,160
What? No... No!

605
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,920
Type and send it. Quickly.

606
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,999
- Have you sent it?
- What's the address?

607
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,360
22 Northumberland Street. Hurry up!

608
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,920
That's...

609
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,879
That's the pink lady's case,
that's Jennifer Wilson's case.

610
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,240
Yes, obviously.

611
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,959
- Oh, perhaps I should mention I didn't kill her.
- I never said you did.

612
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,079
Why not? Given that text and the fact
I have her case it's a perfectly logical assumption.

613
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,360
Do people usually assume
you're the murderer?

614
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,000
Now and then, yes.

615
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,560
Okay...

616
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,799
- How did you get this?
- By looking.

617
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,639
- Where?
- The killer must have driven her to Lauriston Gardens.

618
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,519
He could only keep her case
by accident if it was in the car.

619
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,319
Nobody could be seen with this case
without drawing attention,

620
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,239
particularly a man,
which is statistically more likely.

621
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,839
So obviously he'd feel compelled
to get rid of it.

622
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,959
Wouldn't have taken him more than
five minutes to realise his mistake.

623
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:00,639
I checked every backstreet wide enough for a car
five minutes from Lauriston Gardens,

624
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,199
and anywhere you could dispose of a
bulky object without being observed.

625
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,480
Took me less than an hour
to find the right skip.

626
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,679
Pink. You got all that because
you realised the case would be pink?

627
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,999
- It had to be pink, obviously.
- Why didn't I think of that?

628
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,599
Because you're an idiot.

629
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,279
No, no, no, don't look like that.
Practically everyone is.

630
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,999
Now, look. Do you see what's missing?

631
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,200
From the case? How could I?

632
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,959
Her phone. Where's her mobile phone?

633
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,479
There was no phone on the body,
there's no phone in the case.

634
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,999
We know she had one.
You just texted it.

635
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,319
Maybe she left it at home.

636
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:36,559
She has a string of lovers and she's careful about it.
She never leaves her phone at home.

637
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,200
Er...

638
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,960
Why did I just send that text?

639
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,359
Well, the question is
where is her phone now?

640
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,960
- She could have lost it.
- Yes, or...?

641
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,880
The murderer... You think
the murderer has the phone?

642
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:57,160
Maybe she... left it when she left her case.
Maybe he took it from her for some reason.

643
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,599
Either way, the balance of probability is
the murderer has her phone.

644
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:06,159
Sorry...what are we doing? Did I just text a murderer?
What good will that do?

645
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,239
A few hours after his last victim,

646
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,640
and now he receives a text
that can only be from her.

647
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:21,639
If somebody had just found that phone
they'd ignore a text like that, but the murderer...

648
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,320
would panic.

649
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,519
- Have you talked to the police?
- Four people are dead, there isn't time.

650
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,239
So why are you talking to me?

651
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,000
Mrs. Hudson took my skull.

652
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,159
So I'm basically filling in
for your skull?

653
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,439
Relax, you're doing fine.

654
00:47:37,442 --> 00:47:38,511
- Well?
- Well, what?

655
00:47:38,534 --> 00:47:41,719
Well... You could
just sit there and... watch telly.

656
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,505
- What, you want me to come with you?
- I like company when I go out,

657
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:46,384
and I think better when I talk aloud.

658
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,799
The skull just
attracts attention, so...

659
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,239
- Problem?
- Yeah, Sergeant Donovan.

660
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,079
What about her?

661
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,159
She said...

662
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,400
you get off on this. You enjoy it.

663
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,000
And I said "dangerous",
and here you are.

664
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,120
Damn it!

665
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,519
- Where are we going?
- Northumberland Street's a five-minute walk from here.

666
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,079
- You think he's stupid enough to go there?
- No... I think he's brilliant enough.

667
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,039
I love the brilliant ones. They're
all so desperate to get caught.

668
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,279
- Why?
- Appreciation!

669
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,959
Applause! At long last the spotlight.

670
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,679
- That's the frailty of genius, John, it needs an audience.
- Yeah.

671
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,999
This is his hunting ground.
Right here in the heart of the city.

672
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,359
Now that we know his victims were
abducted, that changes everything.

673
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,319
Because all of his victims
disappeared from busy streets,

674
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,360
crowded places,
but nobody saw them go.

675
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,679
Think! Who do we trust,
even though we don't know them?

676
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:54,039
Who passes unnoticed
wherever they go?

677
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,359
Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?

678
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,479
Don't know. Who?

679
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,440
Haven't the faintest. Hungry?

680
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,680
Thank you, Billy.

681
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,839
22 Northumberland Street.

682
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,119
Keep your eyes on it.

683
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:17,079
He's not just going to ring
the doorbell. He'd need to be mad.

684
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,599
He has killed four people.

685
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,120
Okay.

686
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,319
Sherlock!

687
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,879
Anything on the menu,
whatever you want, free.

688
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,159
On the house, for you
and for your date.

689
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,879
- Do you want to eat?
- I'm not his date.

690
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,079
This man got me off a murder charge.

691
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:38,599
This is Angelo. Three years ago I proved to Lestrade
at the time of a particularly vicious triple murder

692
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,679
that Angelo was elsewhere,
house-breaking.

693
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:44,399
- He cleared my name.
- I cleared it a bit. Anything happening opposite?

694
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,599
Nothing.

695
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,399
- But for this man, I'd have gone to prison.
- You did go to prison.

696
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,119
I'll get a candle for the table.
It's more romantic.

697
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,640
I'm not his date!

698
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,520
You may as well eat.
We might have a long wait.

699
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,040
Thanks.

700
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,160
People don't have arch-enemies.

701
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,160
- I'm sorry?
- In real life.

702
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,559
There are no arch-enemies
in real life. Doesn't happen.

703
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,919
Doesn't it? Sounds a bit dull.

704
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,919
So who did I meet?

705
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,760
What do real people have, then,
in their..."real lives"?

706
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,239
Friends?

707
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,479
People they know, people they like,
people they don't like...

708
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,359
- Girlfriends, boyfriends.
- Yes, well, as I was saying... Dull.

709
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,959
You don't have a girlfriend, then.

710
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,039
Girlfriend? No, not really my area.

711
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,480
Mm.

712
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,080
Oh, right.

713
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,679
Do you have a... boyfriend?
Which is fine, by the way.

714
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,760
I know it's fine.

715
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,599
- So you've got a boyfriend then.
- No.

716
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,440
Right. Okay.

717
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,640
You're unattached. Like me.

718
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,400
Fine. Good.

719
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,279
John, erm...

720
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,039
I think you should know that
I consider myself married to my work,

721
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,084
and while I'm flattered by your interest,
I'm really not looking for any...

722
00:51:16,108 --> 00:51:19,120
No. I'm... not asking. No.

723
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:23,080
I'm just saying, it's all fine.

724
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,520
Good.

725
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,400
Thank you.

726
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,519
Look across the street.
Taxi. It's stopped.

727
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,440
Nobody getting in,
and nobody getting out.

728
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,760
Why a taxi?

729
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,480
- Oh, that's clever. Is it clever? Why is it clever?
- That's him.

730
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,639
Don't stare.

731
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,680
- You're staring.
- We can't both stare.

732
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,640
Sorry...

733
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,400
I've got the cab number.
Good for you.

734
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,239
Right turn, one way, roadworks,
traffic lights, bus lane,

735
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,640
pedestrian crossing, left turn only,
traffic lights.

736
00:52:26,834 --> 00:52:28,044
- Hey!
- Sorry.

737
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,680
Come on, John...

738
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,600
Come on, John. We're losing him!

739
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,120
This way.

740
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,319
No, this way!

741
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,120
Sorry...

742
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,960
Police! Open her up.

743
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,239
No...

744
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,440
Teeth, tan. What... Californian...?

745
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,239
LA, Santa Monica. Just arrived.

746
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,160
- How could you possibly know that?
- The luggage.

747
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,599
Probably your first trip
to London, right?

748
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,039
Going by your final destination
and the cabbie's route.

749
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,079
Sorry... Are you guys the police?

750
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,439
Yeah. Everything all right?

751
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,320
Yeah.

752
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,400
Welcome to London.

753
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,480
Er, any problems... Just let us know.

754
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,719
- Basically just a cab that happened to slow down.
- Basically.

755
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,759
- Not the murderer.
- Not the murderer, no.

756
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,799
Wrong country, good alibi.

757
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,960
- As they go.
- Hey, where did you get this?

758
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,199
- Detective Inspector Lestrade?
- Yeah.

759
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,079
I pickpocket him when he's annoying.

760
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,600
You can keep that one,
I've got plenty at the flat.

761
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,359
- What?
- Nothing, just... "Welcome to London".

762
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,960
- Got your breath back?
- Ready when you are.

763
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,120
Okay...

764
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,879
That was ridiculous.

765
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:23,399
That was the most
ridiculous thing... I've ever done.

766
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,760
And you invaded Afghanistan.

767
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,679
That wasn't just me.

768
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,319
Why aren't we back
at the restaurant?

769
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,559
They can keep an eye out.

770
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,559
It was a long shot anyway.

771
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,480
So what were we doing there?

772
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,040
Oh, just passing the time.

773
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,799
And proving a point.

774
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,359
- What point?
- You.

775
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,399
Mrs. Hudson! Dr. Watson
will take the room upstairs.

776
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,879
Says who?

777
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,479
Says the man at the door.

778
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:08,360
Sherlock texted me.
He said you forgot this.

779
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,800
Ah...

780
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,559
Er, thank you.

781
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,760
Thank you.

782
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,799
Sherlock, what have you done?

783
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,920
- Mrs. Hudson?
- Upstairs.

784
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,879
- What are you doing?
- Well, I knew you'd find the case, I'm not stupid.

785
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,590
- You can't just break into my flat.
- You can't withhold evidence...

786
00:56:31,613 --> 00:56:33,057
And I didn't break in.

787
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,439
Well, what do you call this then?

788
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,119
- It's a drugs bust.
- Seriously? This guy, a junkie?

789
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,199
- Have you met him?
- John...

790
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:45,439
You could search this flat all day, you wouldn't
find anything you could call recreational.

791
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,680
- John, you probably want to shut up now.
- But come on...

792
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,359
- No...
- What?

793
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,399
- You?
- Shut up! I'm not your sniffer dog.

794
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,640
No, Anderson's my sniffer dog.

795
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,439
Anderson, what are you doing
here on a drugs bust?

796
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,240
- Oh, I volunteered.
- They all did.

797
00:57:02,264 --> 00:57:05,223
They're not strictly speaking on the
drug squad, but they're very keen.

798
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,199
- Are these human eyes?
- Put those back!

799
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,639
- They were in the microwave.
- It's an experiment.

800
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,079
Keep looking, guys.

801
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,359
Or you could help us properly
and I'll stand them down.

802
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,559
- This is childish.
- Well, I'm dealing with a child.

803
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,599
Sherlock, this is our case. I'm letting you in,
but you do not go off on your own.

804
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:23,679
- Clear?
- So you set up a pretend drugs bust to bully me?

805
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,079
- It stops being pretend if we find anything.
- I am clean!

806
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,919
Is your flat...? All of it?

807
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,559
Don't even smoke.

808
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,760
Neither do I.

809
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,920
So let's work together.

810
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,679
- We've found Rachel.
- Who is she?

811
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,319
Jennifer Wilson's only daughter.

812
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,279
Her daughter?

813
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,839
Why would she write
her daughter's name? Why?

814
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,279
Never mind that, we found the case.

815
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:53,079
According to someone the murderer has the case,
and we found it in the hands of our favourite psychopath.

816
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:56,279
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Do your research.

817
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,959
You need to bring Rachel in
and I need to question her.

818
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,135
- She's dead.
- Excellent. How, when and why?

819
00:58:01,147 --> 00:58:02,943
Is there a connection?
There has to be.

820
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:07,119
I doubt it, since she's been dead fourteen years.
Technically she was never alive.

821
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:12,239
Rachel was Jennifer Wilson's
stillborn daughter, fourteen years ago.

822
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,600
No, that's...

823
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,479
That's not right. How...

824
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,399
Why would she do that? Why?

825
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,559
Why would she think of her daughter in her
last moments? Yup, sociopath, I'm seeing it now.

826
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,599
She didn't think about her daughter.

827
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:28,319
She scratched her name on the floor
with her fingernails. She was dying.

828
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,120
It took effort, it would have hurt.

829
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:35,639
You said that the victims all took the poison
themselves, that he makes them take it...

830
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:40,719
Well, maybe he...I don't know, talks to them.
Maybe he used the death of her daughter somehow.

831
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:44,040
Yeah, but that was ages ago.
Why would she still be upset?

832
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,199
Not good?

833
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,319
Bit not good, yeah.

834
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:54,679
If you were dying... if you'd been murdered,
in your very last few seconds what would you say?

835
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,559
- "Please, God, let me live."
- Use your imagination!

836
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,080
I don't have to.

837
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,599
Yeah, but if you were clever... Jennifer Wilson
running all those lovers, she was clever.

838
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,439
She's trying to tell us something.

839
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,119
Isn't the doorbell working?
Your taxi's here, Sherlock.

840
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:12,401
- I didn't order a taxi. Go away.
- Oh, dear. They're making such a mess.

841
00:59:12,412 --> 00:59:15,359
- What are they looking for?
- It's a drugs bust, Mrs. Hudson.

842
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:18,479
But they're just for my hip.
They're herbal soothers...

843
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,599
Shut up, everybody! Don't speak,
don't breathe. I'm trying to think.

844
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,879
Anderson, face the other way.
You're putting me off.

845
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,439
- What? My face is...?
- Everybody quiet and still.

846
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,719
- Anderson, turn your back.
- Oh, for God's sake!

847
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,399
Your back, now, please!

848
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,399
- Come on, think. Quick!
- What about your taxi?

849
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,640
Mrs. Hudson!

850
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,079
Oh...

851
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,319
Ah!

852
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:43,879
She was clever. Clever, yes!

853
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:48,319
She's cleverer than you lot and she's
dead. Do you see, do you get it?

854
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:51,919
She didn't lose her phone, she
never lost it. She planted it on him.

855
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,959
When she got out of the car, she
knew that she was going to her death.

856
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,558
She left the phone in order to
lead us to her killer.

857
00:59:58,582 --> 01:00:01,959
- But how?
- What do you mean, how?

858
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,560
Rachel!

859
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,480
Don't you see? Rachel!

860
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,599
Oh...

861
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,279
Look at you lot.
You're all so vacant.

862
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:15,079
Is it nice not being me?
It must be so relaxing.

863
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,239
Rachel is not a name.

864
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,119
Then what is it? John...
On the luggage, there's a label.

865
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,200
E-mail address.

866
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:26,079
Er, jennie.pink@mephone.org.uk.

867
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,729
She didn't have a laptop, which means
she did her business on her phone.

868
01:00:29,752 --> 01:00:32,999
A smartphone, it's e-mail enabled.
So there was a website for her account.

869
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,159
The username is her e-mail address...
And all together, the password is?

870
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,439
- Rachel.
- So we can read her e-mails. So what?

871
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,439
Anderson, don't talk out loud.
You lower the IQ of the whole street.

872
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:45,239
We can do much more than that.
It's a smartphone, it's got GPS.

873
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:50,039
Which means if you lose it you can locate it online.
She's leading us directly to the man who killed her.

874
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:52,159
- Unless he got rid of it.
- We know he didn't.

875
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,679
- Come on, come on. Quickly!
- Sherlock, dear. This taxi driver...

876
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,360
Mrs. Hudson, isn't it time
for your evening soother?

877
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,439
Get vehicles, get a helicopter. This
phone battery won't last for ever.

878
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,599
We'll just have a map reference,
not a name. It's a start!

879
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,119
- Sherlock...
- Narrows it down from just anyone in London.

880
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,599
- It's the first proper lead that we've had.
- Sherlock...

881
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,039
Where is it? Quickly, where?

882
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:17,040
Here. It's... in 221 Baker Street.

883
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,879
How can it be here?

884
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,279
How?

885
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:25,799
Maybe it was in the case when you
brought it back and it... fell out somewhere.

886
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,399
What, and I didn't notice it?
Me? I didn't notice?

887
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,199
Anyway, we texted him
and he called back.

888
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,239
Guys, we're also looking
for a mobile somewhere here,

889
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,360
belonged to the victim...
Who do we trust, even if we don't know them?

890
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,120
Who passes unnoticed
wherever they go?

891
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:57,120
Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?

892
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,119
- Sherlock, you okay?
- What...?

893
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,359
Yeah, yeah... I'm fine.

894
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,319
So, how can the phone be here?

895
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,559
Don't know.

896
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,639
- I'll try it again.
- Good idea.

897
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,319
Where are you going?

898
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:50,799
Fresh air, just popping outside
for a moment. Won't be long.

899
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,920
- You sure you're all right?
- I'm fine.

900
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,800
Taxi for Sherlock Holmes.

901
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,279
I didn't order a taxi.

902
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:12,400
Doesn't mean you don't need one.

903
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,280
You're the cabbie.

904
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:19,200
The one who stopped outside
Northumberland Street.

905
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,439
It was you. Not your passenger.

906
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:29,599
See?
No-one ever thinks about the cabbie.

907
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,599
It's like you're invisible.

908
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,400
Just the back of an 'ead.

909
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,080
Proper advantage
for a serial killer.

910
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,400
- Is this a confession?
- Oh, yeah.

911
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,679
I'll tell you what else...

912
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,720
If you call the coppers now,
I won't run.

913
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,519
I'll sit quiet and they can
take me down, I promise.

914
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,839
Why?

915
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:55,800
- Cos you're not going to do that.
- Am I not?

916
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,639
I didn't kill those four people,
Mr. Holmes.

917
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,799
I spoke to 'em...

918
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,880
and they killed themselves.

919
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:09,600
If you get the coppers now,
I'll promise you one thing.

920
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,320
I will never tell you what I said.

921
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:22,120
No-one else will die, though, and
I believe they call that a result.

922
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,120
And you won't ever understand
how those people died.

923
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,480
What kind of result
do you care about?

924
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,240
If I wanted to understand...

925
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,119
- What would I do?
- Let me take you for a ride.

926
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:54,880
- So you can kill me too?
- I don't want to kill you, Mr. Holmes.

927
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,040
I'm going to talk to ya...

928
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,680
And then you're
going to kill yourself.

929
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,679
He just got in a cab...
It's Sherlock. He just drove off in a cab.

930
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,279
I told you, he does that.

931
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,799
He bloody left again.

932
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,519
We're wasting our time!

933
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,920
I'm...calling the phone,
it's ringing out.

934
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,639
And if it's ringing, it's not here.

935
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:48,559
- I'll try the search again.
- Does it matter? Does any of it?

936
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:54,360
He's just a lunatic, and he'll always let you down.
And you're wasting your time. All our time.

937
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,839
Okay, everybody...

938
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,360
Done here.

939
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,479
How did you find me?

940
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,320
Oh, I recognised ya.

941
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,880
Soon as I saw you chasing my cab.

942
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,000
Sherlock Holmes!

943
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,480
I was warned about you.

944
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:24,359
I've been on your website, too.
Brilliant stuff! Loved it.

945
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:28,000
- Who warned you about me?
- Just someone out there who's noticed.

946
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,200
Who?

947
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,039
Who would notice me?

948
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:43,239
- You're too modest, Mr. Holmes.
- I'm really not.

949
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,520
Got yourself a fan.

950
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,199
Tell me more.

951
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,880
That's all you're going to know.

952
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,000
In this lifetime.

953
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:56,519
Why did he do that?
Why did he have to leave?

954
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,879
You know him better than I do.

955
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,120
I've known him for five years,
and no, I don't.

956
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,240
So why do you put up with him?

957
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,200
Because I'm desperate, that's why.

958
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,919
And because Sherlock Holmes
is a great man...

959
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:16,679
and I think one day,
if we're very, very lucky,

960
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,880
he might even be a good one.

961
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,240
Where are we?

962
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:45,599
You know every street in London.
You know exactly where we are.

963
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,599
Roland-Kerr
Further Education College.

964
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,559
- Why here?
- It's open.

965
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,439
Cleaners are in.

966
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,639
One thing about being a cabbie...
You always know a nice quiet spot for a murder.

967
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,720
I'm surprised more of us
don't branch out.

968
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,680
- And you just walk your victims in?
- How?

969
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,319
Oh... Dull.

970
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,880
Don't worry. It gets better.

971
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:14,239
- You can't make people take their own lives at gunpoint.
- I don't.

972
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,039
It's much better than that.

973
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:20,120
Don't need this with you.
Cos you'll follow me.

974
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:14,040
Well, what do you think?

975
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,239
It's up to you.

976
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,080
You're the one
who's going to die here.

977
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:24,040
- No, I'm not.
- That's what they all say.

978
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,760
Shall we talk?

979
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,040
Bit risky, wasn't it?

980
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:48,079
Took me away under the eye of
about half a dozen policemen.

981
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,399
They're not that stupid.

982
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,599
And Mrs. Hudson will remember you.

983
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,559
You call that a risk? Nah...

984
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,600
This is a risk.

985
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,959
Oh, I like this bit.

986
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,800
Cos you don't get it yet, do ya?

987
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:13,840
But you're about to.

988
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,520
I just have to do this...

989
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,320
Weren't expecting that, were ya?

990
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,039
Oh, you're going to love this.

991
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:30,720
- Love what?
- Sherlock Holmes! Look at you!

992
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:37,239
Here in the flesh. That website
of yours, your fan told me about it.

993
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:38,919
My fan?

994
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:41,519
You are brilliant.

995
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,920
You are a proper genius.

996
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:47,919
The Science of Deduction.
Now, that...

997
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,000
is proper thinking.

998
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:54,200
Between you and me sitting here,
why can't people think?

999
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,160
Don't it make you mad?

1000
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,920
Why can't people just think?

1001
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:09,319
Oh, I see...
So you're a proper genius too.

1002
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,520
Don't look it, do I?

1003
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,600
Funny little man driving a cab.

1004
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,839
But you'll know better in a minute.

1005
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,840
Chances are it'll be
the last thing you ever know.

1006
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,320
Okay, two bottles. Explain.

1007
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,519
There's a good bottle
and a bad bottle.

1008
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,119
You take the pill from
the good bottle, you live.

1009
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:35,279
You take the pill from
the bad bottle... you die.

1010
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,919
- Both bottles are of course identical.
- In every way.

1011
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,916
- And you know which is which.
- Of course I know.

1012
01:11:39,927 --> 01:11:40,855
But I don't.

1013
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,719
Wouldn't be a game if you knew.
You're the one who chooses.

1014
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:47,720
Why should I? I've got nothing
to go on. What's in it for me?

1015
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,520
I haven't told you the best bit yet.

1016
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,719
Whatever bottle you choose,

1017
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,400
I take the pill from the other one.

1018
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,839
And then together...

1019
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,320
we take our medicine.

1020
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:05,400
I won't cheat. It's your choice.

1021
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,800
I'll take whatever pill you don't.

1022
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:14,119
Didn't expect that,
did you, Mr. Holmes?

1023
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:16,679
This is what you did
to the rest of them...

1024
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:19,080
- you gave them a choice?
- And now I'm giving you one.

1025
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,639
You take your time.

1026
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,520
Get yourself together.

1027
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:28,479
- I want your best game.
- It's not a game, it's chance.

1028
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,200
I've played four times. I'm alive.

1029
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:35,080
It's not chance, Mr. Holmes,
it's chess.

1030
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,679
It's a game of chess,

1031
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:42,360
with one move... and one survivor.

1032
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:46,199
And this... this...

1033
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,960
is the move.

1034
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,599
Did I just give you the good bottle
or the bad bottle?

1035
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,840
You can choose either one.

1036
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,359
No, Detective Inspector Lestrade,
I need to speak to him.

1037
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,119
It's important. It's an emergency.

1038
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,400
Er, left here, please. Left here...

1039
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,479
You ready yet, Mr. Holmes?

1040
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:30,279
- Ready to play?
- Play what? It's a 50:50 chance.

1041
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,920
You're not playing the numbers,
you're playing me.

1042
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,999
Did I just give you the good pill
or the bad pill?

1043
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,119
Is it a bluff,

1044
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:42,199
or a double bluff?

1045
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,319
- Or a triple bluff?
- It's still just chance.

1046
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,319
Four people, in a row?
It's not chance.

1047
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,000
- Luck.
- It's genius!

1048
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:52,199
I know how people think.

1049
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,160
I know how people think I think.

1050
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,600
I can see it all
like a map inside my head.

1051
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,919
Everyone's so stupid, even you.

1052
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,600
Or maybe God just loves me.

1053
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,800
Either way,
you're wasted as a cabbie.

1054
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,040
So...

1055
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:25,119
You risked your life four times
just to kill strangers? Why?

1056
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,679
Time to play.

1057
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:29,199
Oh, I am playing.

1058
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,400
This is my turn.

1059
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:35,919
There's shaving foam behind your left
ear. Nobody's pointed it out to you.

1060
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,297
Traces of where it's happened before,
so obviously you live on your own.

1061
01:14:39,321 --> 01:14:40,659
There's no one to tell you.

1062
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:43,599
But there's a photograph of children.
Their mother's been cut out.

1063
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,319
If she'd died, she'd still be there.

1064
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,279
The photograph's old,
but the frame's new.

1065
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,679
You think of your children,
but you don't get to see them.

1066
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:51,999
Estranged father.

1067
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,919
She took the kids,

1068
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:57,360
but you still love them
and it still hurts.

1069
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,640
Ah, but there's more.

1070
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,679
Your clothes. Recently laundered,

1071
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:06,400
but everything you're wearing
is at least... three years old?

1072
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:10,320
Keeping up appearances,
but not planning ahead.

1073
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:15,320
And here you are on a kamikaze
murder spree. What's that about?

1074
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,639
Ah...

1075
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,839
Three years ago.
Is that when they told you?

1076
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:26,199
Told me what?

1077
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,279
- That you're a dead man walking.
- So are you.

1078
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,919
You don't have long, though.

1079
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,040
Am I right?

1080
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,400
Aneurism. Right in 'ere.

1081
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:41,279
Any breath could be my last.

1082
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,759
And because you're dying,
you've just murdered four people.

1083
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,640
I've outlived four people.

1084
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,040
That's the most fun you can have
with an aneurism.

1085
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:55,759
No... No, there's something else.

1086
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,759
You didn't just kill four people
because you're bitter. Bitterness is a paralytic.

1087
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,760
Love is a much more vicious motivator.

1088
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:08,399
Somehow, this is about your children.

1089
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,800
Oh...

1090
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,280
- You are good, ain't ya?
- But how?

1091
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:18,520
When I die they won't get much,
my kids.

1092
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,879
Not a lot of money in driving cabs.

1093
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,239
- Or serial killing.
- You'd be surprised.

1094
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,880
Surprise me.

1095
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,639
I have a sponsor.

1096
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:35,919
- You have a what?
- For every life I take, money goes to my kids.

1097
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:39,360
The more I kill...
the better off they'll be.

1098
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,439
You see? It's nicer than you think.

1099
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,399
Who'd sponsor a serial killer?

1100
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:48,040
Who'd be a fan of Sherlock Holmes?

1101
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:54,439
You're not the only one
to enjoy a good murder.

1102
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:58,600
There's others out there just
like you, except you're just a man.

1103
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:02,200
And they're so much more than that.

1104
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,759
What do you mean...

1105
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,800
more than a man?

1106
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,919
An organisation...? What?

1107
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:15,159
There's a name, that no-one says.

1108
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,960
And I'm not going to say it either.

1109
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,760
Now, enough chatter.

1110
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,480
Time to choose.

1111
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,760
Sherlock?!

1112
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,919
Sherlock!

1113
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:40,360
What if I don't choose either?
I could just walk out of here.

1114
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:46,359
You can take a 50:50 chance,

1115
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:49,320
or I can shoot you in the head.

1116
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,319
Funnily enough,

1117
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,319
no-one's ever gone for that option.

1118
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,360
I'll have the gun, please.

1119
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,040
Are you sure?

1120
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:02,839
Definitely. The gun.

1121
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:04,880
You don't want to phone a friend?

1122
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:08,240
The gun.

1123
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,920
I know a real gun when I see one.

1124
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,120
- None of the others did.
- Clearly.

1125
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:23,559
Well, this has been very interesting.

1126
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:26,040
I look forward to the court case.

1127
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:31,920
Just before you go,
did you figure it out?

1128
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,479
Which one's the good bottle?

1129
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,640
Course. Child's play.

1130
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:39,920
Well, which one, then?

1131
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,879
Which one would you have picked?

1132
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:46,000
Just so I know whether
I could have beaten you.

1133
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,079
Come on!

1134
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:50,880
Play the game.

1135
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:05,840
Oh!

1136
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,240
Interesting.

1137
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:19,040
So what do you think?

1138
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,080
Shall we?

1139
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:25,920
Really... What do you think?

1140
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,760
Can you beat me?

1141
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:34,040
Are you clever enough...

1142
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,920
to bet your life?

1143
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,240
Sherlock!

1144
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:54,560
I bet you get bored, don't you?

1145
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,479
I know you do.

1146
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:01,200
A man like you. So clever.

1147
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:06,600
But what's the point of being clever
if you can't prove it?

1148
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,400
Still the addict.

1149
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:14,720
But this... this is what
you're really addicted to.

1150
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:18,120
You'll do anything...

1151
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:23,320
anything at all,
to stop being bored.

1152
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,080
You're not bored now, are ya?

1153
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,399
Isn't it good?

1154
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,159
Was I right?

1155
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:47,999
I was, wasn't I?

1156
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,400
Did I get it right?!

1157
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:56,120
Okay... Tell me this.

1158
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,959
Your sponsor. Who was it?

1159
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:02,039
The one who told you about me,
my fan.

1160
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,879
I want a name.

1161
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:05,399
No...

1162
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:08,519
You're dying,
but there's still time to hurt you.

1163
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:11,160
Give me... a name.

1164
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,640
A name!
Now.

1165
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:19,919
The name!

1166
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:23,600
Moriarty!

1167
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:48,239
Why have I got this blanket?
They keep putting this blanket on me.

1168
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:49,959
Yeah, it's for shock.
I'm not in shock.

1169
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:52,640
Yeah, but some of the guys
want to take photographs.

1170
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:56,039
So, the shooter. No sign?

1171
01:21:56,040 --> 01:22:00,159
Cleared off before we got here. But a guy like that
would have had enemies, I suppose.

1172
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:03,359
One of them could have
been following him, but...

1173
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,439
we've got nothing to go on.

1174
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,040
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

1175
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:10,199
Okay. Give me.

1176
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:13,199
The bullet they just dug
out of the wall's from a handgun.

1177
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,937
A kill shot over that distance,
that's a crack shot.

1178
01:22:15,949 --> 01:22:17,745
But not just a marksman,
a fighter.

1179
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:21,399
His hands couldn't have shaken at all
so clearly he's acclimatised to violence.

1180
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:25,279
He didn't fire until I was in immediate
danger though, so strong moral principle.

1181
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:29,359
You're looking for a man probably with
a history of military service, and...

1182
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,640
nerves of steel...

1183
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:40,679
- Actually, do you know what? Ignore me.
- Sorry? Ignore all of that.

1184
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:43,399
It's just the er... the shock talking.

1185
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,279
- Where are you going?
- I just need to... talk about the rent.

1186
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:49,679
- I've still got questions.
- What now? I'm in shock. Look, I've got a blanket.

1187
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:54,920
- Sherlock!
- And, I just caught you a serial killer... More or less.

1188
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,920
Okay. We'll pull you in tomorrow,
off you go.

1189
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:12,199
Erm... Sergeant Donovan has...
just been explaining everything.

1190
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,240
The two pills...

1191
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,240
- Dreadful business, isn't it?
- Dreadful.

1192
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:19,440
Good shot.

1193
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:23,720
- Yes, must have been. Through that window.
- Well, you'd know.

1194
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:28,199
Need to get the powder burns
out of your fingers.

1195
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:32,319
I don't suppose you'd serve time for
this, but let's avoid the court case.

1196
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,079
- Are you all right?
- Yes, of course I'm all right.

1197
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:36,760
- Well, you have just killed a man.
- Yes...

1198
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:41,840
That's true, isn't it?

1199
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,120
But he wasn't a very nice man.

1200
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:50,559
- No. No, he wasn't, really, was he?
- Frankly a bloody awful cabbie.

1201
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,519
That's true, he was a bad cabbie.

1202
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,279
You should have seen
the route he took us to get here.

1203
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:58,999
Stop it! We can't giggle,
it's a crime scene. Stop it.

1204
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,479
- Well, you're the one who shot him.
- Keep your voice down.

1205
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:05,039
Sorry, it's just erm...
nerves, I think. Sorry.

1206
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:09,360
- You were going to take that damn pill, weren't you?
- Course I wasn't.

1207
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:12,359
Biding my time. Knew you'd turn up.

1208
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:13,999
No, you didn't.

1209
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,719
That's how you get your kicks, isn't it?
You risk your life to prove you're clever.

1210
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:20,680
- Why would I do that?
- Because you're an idiot.

1211
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:24,839
- Dinner?
- Starving.

1212
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:27,599
End of Baker Street there's
a good Chinese. Stays open till two.

1213
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,159
You can tell a good Chinese by the
bottom third of the door handle.

1214
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:34,119
Sherlock... That's him, that's
the man I was talking to you about.

1215
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:36,719
I know exactly who that is.

1216
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:39,319
So... Another case cracked.

1217
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,839
How very public-spirited.

1218
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:44,160
Though that's never really
your motivation, is it?

1219
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:46,839
What are you doing here?

1220
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,399
As ever, I'm concerned about you.

1221
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,799
Yes, I've been hearing
about your "concern".

1222
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,559
Always so aggressive.

1223
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:55,439
Did it never occur to you that
you and I belong on the same side?

1224
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,519
Oddly enough, no.

1225
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:00,599
We have more in common
than you'd like to believe.

1226
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:03,719
This petty feud between us
is simply childish.

1227
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:07,480
People will suffer. And you know
how it always upset Mummy.

1228
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,279
I upset her?

1229
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:12,639
Me?

1230
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,959
It wasn't me that upset her, Mycroft.

1231
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,359
No. No, wait...

1232
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:17,759
Mummy? Who's Mummy?

1233
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,199
Mother. Our mother.

1234
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,879
This is my brother, Mycroft.

1235
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:23,840
Putting on weight again?

1236
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,279
- Losing it, in fact.
- He's your brother?

1237
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,160
Course he's my brother.

1238
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:31,720
- So he's not...
- Not what?

1239
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:35,640
I don't know... Criminal mastermind?

1240
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,959
- Close enough.
- For goodness' sake.

1241
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,279
I occupy a minor position
in the British government.

1242
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:46,159
He is the British government, when he's not
too busy being the British secret service

1243
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,799
or the CIA on a freelance basis.

1244
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:51,399
Good evening, Mycroft. Try not
to start a war before I get home,

1245
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:53,040
you know what it does
for the traffic.

1246
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:59,319
So, when you say you're concerned about him,
you actually are concerned?

1247
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:00,840
Yes, of course.

1248
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,960
I mean, it actually is
a childish feud?

1249
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,919
He's always been so resentful.

1250
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:10,559
- You can imagine the Christmas dinners.
- Yeah...

1251
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,600
No... God, no.

1252
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:15,519
I'd better erm...

1253
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,679
Hello again.

1254
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:20,920
- Hello.
- We met earlier on this evening.

1255
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:23,959
- Oh!
- Okay. Goodnight.

1256
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,600
Goodnight, Dr. Watson.

1257
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,199
- So, dim sum.
- Mmm!

1258
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:31,719
- I can always predict the fortune cookies.
- No, you can't.

1259
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,759
Almost can. You did get shot, though.

1260
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:36,119
- Sorry?
- In Afghanistan. There was an actual wound.

1261
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:38,519
- Oh. Yeah, shoulder.
- Shoulder! I thought so.

1262
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,273
- No, you didn't.
- The left one.

1263
01:26:40,285 --> 01:26:41,823
- Lucky guess.
- I never guess.

1264
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,399
Yes, you do.

1265
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:46,039
- What are you so happy about?
- Moriarty.

1266
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:49,200
- What's Moriarty?
- I've absolutely no idea.

1267
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:53,479
Sir, shall we go?

1268
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:56,279
Interesting, that soldier fellow.

1269
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:59,039
He could be the making
of my brother...

1270
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,680
or make him worse than ever.

1271
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:04,679
Either way, we'd better
upgrade their surveillance status.

1272
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:07,079
Grade three active.

1273
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,080
Sorry, sir... Whose status?

1274
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:14,440
Sherlock Holmes, and Dr. Watson.

1275
01:27:48,271 --> 01:27:52,192
