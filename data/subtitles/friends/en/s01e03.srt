1
00:00:04,685 --> 00:00:06,312
-Hi, guys.
-Hey, Pheebs.

2
00:00:06,587 --> 00:00:08,851
-How did it go?
-Not so good.

3
00:00:09,056 --> 00:00:12,253
He walked me home and said,
"Let's do this again."

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,180
He said, "we should do it again."
That's good, right?

5
00:00:16,397 --> 00:00:21,664
Translated, "Let's do this again"
means, "You'll never see me naked."

6
00:00:22,836 --> 00:00:24,098
Since when?

7
00:00:24,538 --> 00:00:27,701
Since always.
It's, like, dating language.

8
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:31,071
Like, "It's not you"
means, "It is you."

9
00:00:32,513 --> 00:00:36,176
"You're nice" means, "I'll be
dating alcoholics...

10
00:00:36,383 --> 00:00:38,613
...and complaining
about them to you."

11
00:00:39,486 --> 00:00:41,977
"We should see
other people" means:

12
00:00:42,222 --> 00:00:43,849
"Ha-ha, I already am!"

13
00:00:45,392 --> 00:00:46,757
Everybody knows this?

14
00:00:47,795 --> 00:00:48,921
Cushions the blow.

15
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:51,324
Like your parents
putting the dog to sleep...

16
00:00:51,598 --> 00:00:53,930
...and saying it went to a farm.

17
00:00:54,134 --> 00:00:57,228
That's funny. Because our
parents actually did...

18
00:00:57,972 --> 00:01:01,271
...send our dog off to live on a farm.

19
00:01:01,608 --> 00:01:03,041
Ross?

20
00:01:04,545 --> 00:01:07,309
Hello! The Milner's farm
in Connecticut?

21
00:01:07,514 --> 00:01:09,914
The Milners had this
unbelievable farm.

22
00:01:10,117 --> 00:01:12,677
They had horses and
rabbits to chase.

23
00:01:12,886 --> 00:01:14,319
And it was...

24
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:19,655
Oh, my God! Chi-Chi!

25
00:01:21,962 --> 00:01:24,897
The One With the Thumb

26
00:02:12,713 --> 00:02:15,648
How does it feel knowing
you're about to die?

27
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:19,148
Warden, in five minutes
my pain will be over.

28
00:02:19,353 --> 00:02:24,188
But you'll live with the knowledge
that you sent an honest man to die.

29
00:02:25,392 --> 00:02:27,622
That was really good!

30
00:02:27,828 --> 00:02:29,489
Thanks. Let's keep going.

31
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:33,689
So, what do you want
from me, Dimon? Huh?

32
00:02:36,136 --> 00:02:40,163
I just wanna go back to my cell,
because in my cell I can smoke.

33
00:02:40,374 --> 00:02:42,399
Smoke away!

34
00:02:55,322 --> 00:02:58,723
I think this is why Dimon
smokes in his cell alone.

35
00:02:59,827 --> 00:03:01,920
-What?
-Relax your hand.

36
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:03,926
Let your wrist go.

37
00:03:04,131 --> 00:03:05,758
Not so much!

38
00:03:07,134 --> 00:03:09,466
All right. Now take a puff.

39
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,494
Right.

40
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,768
-Give it to me.
-I'm not giving you a cigarette.

41
00:03:16,977 --> 00:03:20,879
It's fine. Do you want to
get this part or not? Here.

42
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:24,073
Now, don't think
of it as a cigarette.

43
00:03:24,284 --> 00:03:28,550
Think of it as the thing that
has been missing from your hand.

44
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:31,250
When you hold it,
you feel right.

45
00:03:31,692 --> 00:03:32,852
You feel complete.

46
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:36,123
-You miss it?
-No, not so much.

47
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:40,457
All right. Now we smoke.

48
00:03:42,603 --> 00:03:45,595
Oh, my God!

49
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:47,839
-Give me that!
-No. You've got options.

50
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,580
You can smoke it like this:

51
00:03:49,843 --> 00:03:52,073
-Chandler...
-Or hold it in your mouth.

52
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:53,678
Give me the cigarette!

53
00:03:53,881 --> 00:03:55,371
-You try.
-Thank you.

54
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:57,777
Okay, how's this?

55
00:04:00,354 --> 00:04:02,584
Okay, that's not bad.

56
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:06,919
All right, when you're finished,
it's cool if you flick it.

57
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:11,892
All right, you keep practicing...

58
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:14,829
...and I'll go put out the sofa.

59
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:20,902
I thought it was foot size.

60
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:24,942
No. It's the distance
from the tip of a guy's thumb...

61
00:04:25,145 --> 00:04:27,978
...to the tip of his index finger.

62
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,088
That's ridiculous.

63
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:38,789
Can I use either thumb?

64
00:04:39,593 --> 00:04:41,823
I'd rather go with the foot theory.

65
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:45,123
All right. Don't tell me.

66
00:04:45,732 --> 00:04:49,031
Decaf cappuccino for Joey.

67
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:52,401
Coffee, black.

68
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:55,503
Latte.

69
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,941
And an iced tea.

70
00:04:58,612 --> 00:05:01,638
-I'm getting good at this.
-Excellent!

71
00:05:01,848 --> 00:05:03,179
Good for me!

72
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,680
-You okay, Phoebe?
-Yeah...No...

73
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:21,356
It's my bank.

74
00:05:21,568 --> 00:05:23,832
-What did they do?
-It's nothing...

75
00:05:24,037 --> 00:05:27,666
I get my mail and
open their monthly "statement."

76
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:29,569
Easy!

77
00:05:31,345 --> 00:05:34,109
And there's $500 extra in my account.

78
00:05:34,715 --> 00:05:37,912
Satan's minions at work again!

79
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:40,686
Now I have to go deal with them...

80
00:05:40,887 --> 00:05:44,880
-What are you talking about? Keep it!
-It's not mine.

81
00:05:45,092 --> 00:05:46,923
If I kept it, I'd be stealing.

82
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:50,688
But if you spent it,
it would be like shopping.

83
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:55,327
Say I bought a great pair of shoes.

84
00:05:55,535 --> 00:06:00,495
Know what I'd hear with every step?
"Not mine. Not mine. Not mine."

85
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:03,972
Even if I was happy
and skipping, I'd hear:

86
00:06:04,177 --> 00:06:06,907
"Not-not mine. Not-not mine."

87
00:06:07,114 --> 00:06:08,775
We're with you. We got it.

88
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:14,078
I'd never be able to enjoy it.
It'd be this giant karmic debt.

89
00:06:14,288 --> 00:06:16,347
Chandler, what are you doing?

90
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,949
Whaddya doing?

91
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,980
Oh, God!

92
00:06:24,298 --> 00:06:26,823
-What is this?
-I'm smoking!

93
00:06:27,034 --> 00:06:29,559
You've been so good for three years!

94
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,864
And this is my reward.

95
00:06:33,674 --> 00:06:36,871
Think about what you went
through when you quit.

96
00:06:37,077 --> 00:06:40,638
Forget about you. Think about
what we went through!

97
00:06:40,847 --> 00:06:43,077
So this time I won't quit.

98
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:45,751
-Put it out!
-I'm putting it out!

99
00:06:46,987 --> 00:06:48,352
Oh, no!

100
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:50,955
I can't drink this now.

101
00:06:54,928 --> 00:06:56,987
I'm gonna go. I've got a date.

102
00:06:57,197 --> 00:06:59,665
With Alan again?
How's it going?

103
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:03,996
It's going pretty good.
It's nice and we're having fun.

104
00:07:04,204 --> 00:07:06,069
When do we get to meet him?

105
00:07:06,273 --> 00:07:08,138
Let's see, it's Monday...

106
00:07:08,342 --> 00:07:10,003
-Never.
-Come on!

107
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,337
Not after what happened with Steve.

108
00:07:12,546 --> 00:07:17,040
What do you mean?
We love Steve. Steve was sexy!

109
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,109
Sorry.

110
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:24,381
I don't know how I feel yet.
Let me figure it out.

111
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:26,422
Then can we meet him?

112
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:27,615
No.

113
00:07:27,828 --> 00:07:29,455
Sorry.

114
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:35,062
Joey. Let it go.

115
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:40,070
<i>Why should they meet him?</i>

116
00:07:40,474 --> 00:07:43,204
I bring a guy home and they're like...

117
00:07:43,744 --> 00:07:47,180
...coyotes picking off the weak
members of the herd.

118
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:52,284
Listen, as someone who's seen
more than her share of bad beef...

119
00:07:52,486 --> 00:07:56,286
...I'll tell you,
that is not such a terrible thing.

120
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,981
Your friends are just
looking after you.

121
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:02,525
I wish that once I'd date a guy
they liked.

122
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:06,324
You realize the odds of that
happening are slimmer...

123
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:10,094
-...if they never get to meet the guy.
-I know.

124
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:13,568
-Can't I whimper a little bit?
-Whimper.

125
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:17,375
Okay, I'm done.

126
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:20,007
Let it go, Ross.

127
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:22,510
You didn't know Chi-Chi.

128
00:08:26,553 --> 00:08:29,351
-Do you all promise?
-We promise.

129
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:30,580
We'll be good.

130
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:34,192
Chandler, do you promise to be good?

131
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:45,699
You can come in, but your
filter-tip buddy stays outside!

132
00:08:55,348 --> 00:08:58,442
"Dear Ms. Buffay.
Thank you for calling.

133
00:08:58,652 --> 00:09:02,884
We've credited you $500.
We're sorry for the inconvenience...

134
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:06,081
...and hope you'll accept
this football phone...

135
00:09:09,262 --> 00:09:11,423
...as our gift."
Do you believe it?

136
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:14,794
Now I have $1000
and a football phone.

137
00:09:16,403 --> 00:09:19,463
What bank is this?

138
00:09:19,673 --> 00:09:22,198
Okay, it's him.

139
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:24,570
-Who is it?
-<i>Alan.</i>

140
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,180
Chandler! He's here!

141
00:09:29,616 --> 00:09:30,674
Do I look okay?

142
00:09:31,384 --> 00:09:32,817
One more button.

143
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:34,884
Closed! How about closed?

144
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:38,014
-I didn't know.
-Yeah.

145
00:09:39,326 --> 00:09:41,055
Please be good.

146
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:44,059
Remember how much you all like me?

147
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:50,035
Alan, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is Alan.

148
00:09:53,974 --> 00:09:57,273
I've heard so much about
all you guys.

149
00:10:03,984 --> 00:10:06,714
I'll call you tomorrow. Thanks.

150
00:10:10,557 --> 00:10:13,720
Let's let the Alan-bashing begin.

151
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:16,555
Who's gonna take the first shot?

152
00:10:17,664 --> 00:10:18,961
Come on!

153
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:21,697
I'll go.

154
00:10:23,904 --> 00:10:26,270
Let's start with how he
kept picking...

155
00:10:26,473 --> 00:10:29,772
I'm sorry, I can't do this.
We loved him.

156
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,880
Loved him! Yeah! He's great!

157
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:35,776
Wait! We're talking about someone
I'm going out with?

158
00:10:35,982 --> 00:10:37,449
That pimento trick!

159
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:40,950
I'll never look at an olive
the same way again.

160
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:42,644
And did you notice?

161
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:50,819
Know what was great?
His smile was crooked.

162
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,980
-Yes, like the man in the shoe!
-What shoe?

163
00:10:56,336 --> 00:10:57,769
From the rhyme.

164
00:10:57,971 --> 00:10:59,836
<i>There was a man
With a crooked smile</i>

165
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,567
<i>Who lived in a shoe
For a while</i>

166
00:11:06,112 --> 00:11:08,376
So I think Alan...

167
00:11:08,582 --> 00:11:12,746
...is the yardstick by which
future boyfriends will be measured.

168
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:14,147
Future boyfriends?

169
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:17,619
-I think this could be "it."
-Really?

170
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:21,692
I'd marry him for his
David Hasselhoff impression alone.

171
00:11:21,895 --> 00:11:24,762
You know I'll be doing that
at parties.

172
00:11:28,335 --> 00:11:30,929
-Know what I like most?
-What?

173
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:35,004
The way he makes me feel about myself.

174
00:11:57,197 --> 00:11:59,256
How was the game?

175
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:00,933
Well...

176
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:03,659
We won!

177
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:07,335
Fantastic! Question.
How is that possible?

178
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,639
-Alan.
-He was unbelievable!

179
00:12:10,844 --> 00:12:14,541
Like the cartoon where
Bugs Bunny plays every position.

180
00:12:14,748 --> 00:12:18,980
It was first base, Alan.
Second base, Alan...

181
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:25,222
It was like he made us into a team.

182
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:30,362
We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers
a thing or two about softball.

183
00:12:31,464 --> 00:12:33,329
Can I ask a question?

184
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,865
Do you think Alan is sometimes...

185
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:37,058
What?

186
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,898
I don't know. A little too "Alan"?

187
00:12:40,106 --> 00:12:43,633
Oh, no. Not possible.
You can never be too "Alan."

188
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:48,644
It's his innate "Alan-ness"
that we adore.

189
00:12:48,848 --> 00:12:51,840
I, personally, could have
a gallon of Alan.

190
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:01,817
-Hey, Lizzy.
-Hey, weird girl.

191
00:13:02,696 --> 00:13:05,164
-I brought alphabet soup.
-Pick out the vowels?

192
00:13:05,365 --> 00:13:08,334
I left in the Y's.
Because, "sometimes Y."

193
00:13:09,703 --> 00:13:12,069
-And something else.
-Saltines?

194
00:13:12,272 --> 00:13:14,604
No, $1000 and a football phone.

195
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:16,605
What?

196
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,271
Oh, my God!

197
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:22,209
-There's really money in here.
-I know.

198
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:24,110
What are you doing?

199
00:13:24,317 --> 00:13:27,946
I want you to have it.
I don't want it.

200
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:31,248
-I have to give you something.
-Oh, that's fine, no...

201
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:35,053
-Do you want my tinfoil hat?
-No, you need that.

202
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:37,991
-It's okay. Thanks.
-Let me do something.

203
00:13:39,532 --> 00:13:43,491
I'll tell you what. Buy me
a soda and we're even. Okay?

204
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:46,232
-Okay.
-Okay.

205
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:49,658
Keep the change.

206
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:50,893
Thanks, Lizzy.

207
00:14:51,104 --> 00:14:52,264
Want a pretzel?

208
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:55,440
-No, I'm fine. Thanks.
-See you.

209
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:05,747
A thumb?

210
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:10,046
I know. There it was,
just floating...

211
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:13,748
...like this tiny little hitchhiker.

212
00:15:14,627 --> 00:15:18,654
Maybe it's a contest.
Like "collect all five."

213
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:22,732
-Does anyone wanna see?
-No, thanks!

214
00:15:24,637 --> 00:15:26,229
Don't do that. Come on!

215
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:29,101
It's worse than the thumb.

216
00:15:30,343 --> 00:15:33,141
-This is so unfair.
-Why is it unfair?

217
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:36,144
So I have a flaw! Big deal!

218
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:38,977
Joey's knuckle-cracking
isn't annoying?

219
00:15:39,185 --> 00:15:41,346
Ross, over-pronouncing every word.

220
00:15:41,554 --> 00:15:47,151
Monica, who snorts when she laughs.
I mean, what the hell is that thing?

221
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:52,564
I accept those flaws.
Why can't you accept me for this?

222
00:15:58,638 --> 00:16:02,836
Does the knuckle-cracking
bother everybody, or just him?

223
00:16:05,712 --> 00:16:07,509
I could live without it.

224
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:15,583
Is it a little annoying? Or is it like
when Phoebe chews her hair?

225
00:16:17,957 --> 00:16:21,085
Don't listen to him.
I think it's endearing.

226
00:16:21,294 --> 00:16:23,524
Oh, you do, do you?

227
00:16:29,736 --> 00:16:32,864
There's nothing wrong with
speaking correctly.

228
00:16:33,273 --> 00:16:35,833
Indeed there isn't.

229
00:16:38,044 --> 00:16:39,773
I should get back to work.

230
00:16:39,979 --> 00:16:43,642
Otherwise someone might
get what they ordered.

231
00:16:45,818 --> 00:16:49,914
The hair comes out
and the gloves come off.

232
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:07,969
Ever go out with a guy
your friends really like?

233
00:17:08,174 --> 00:17:09,903
No.

234
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:15,543
I'm going out with a guy
my friends really like.

235
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:18,774
Are we talking about the coyotes here?

236
00:17:18,985 --> 00:17:22,785
All right! A cow got through.

237
00:17:23,523 --> 00:17:24,785
Can you believe it?

238
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,652
It's just, you know what?

239
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:29,657
I just don't feel the "thing."

240
00:17:29,862 --> 00:17:32,490
They feel the thing. I don't feel it.

241
00:17:32,699 --> 00:17:37,500
Honey, you should always
feel the thing.

242
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:43,540
If that's how you feel about the guy,
dump him.

243
00:17:43,743 --> 00:17:47,179
-It's gonna be really hard.
-He'll get over it.

244
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,408
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five
I'm worried about.

245
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:56,746
-Don't you respect your body?
-Don't you see what you're doing?

246
00:17:56,956 --> 00:18:00,892
I've had it with your cancer,
emphysema and heart disease.

247
00:18:01,294 --> 00:18:05,492
The bottom line is, smoking is cool,
and you know it.

248
00:18:09,035 --> 00:18:10,832
Alan wants to speak to you.

249
00:18:11,037 --> 00:18:13,232
Really? He does?

250
00:18:14,173 --> 00:18:16,903
Hey, buddy! What's up?

251
00:18:18,311 --> 00:18:20,336
She told you about that, huh?

252
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:25,377
Well, yeah. I have one now and then.
Well, yeah, now.

253
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:28,185
It's not that...

254
00:18:30,123 --> 00:18:32,057
Well, that's true.

255
00:18:34,394 --> 00:18:38,592
Gee, you know, no one's ever put it
like that before.

256
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:41,392
Well, okay. Thanks.

257
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,371
God, he's good.

258
00:18:54,047 --> 00:18:57,710
-If only he were a woman.
-Yeah.

259
00:19:02,955 --> 00:19:04,149
Lamb Chop!

260
00:19:04,357 --> 00:19:07,554
How old is that sock?

261
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,160
If I had a sock on my hand
for 30 years, it'd be talking too.

262
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:18,629
I think it's time to change somebody's
nicotine patch.

263
00:19:22,175 --> 00:19:24,973
-Where's Joey?
-Joey ate my last stick of gum...

264
00:19:25,178 --> 00:19:27,271
...so I killed him.

265
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:29,840
Do you think that was wrong?

266
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:34,148
-I think he's across the hall.
-Thanks.

267
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,747
There you go.

268
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,991
I'm alive with pleasure now.

269
00:19:40,193 --> 00:19:43,959
Phoebe, do you want
the rest of that Pop-Tart?

270
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:48,031
Does anyone want
the rest of this Pop-Tart?

271
00:19:49,535 --> 00:19:51,332
Hey, I might.

272
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:53,763
I'm sorry.

273
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:58,433
The soda people gave me $7000
for the thumb.

274
00:19:59,812 --> 00:20:02,975
And on my way over here
I stepped in gum.

275
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:05,879
What is up with the universe?

276
00:20:06,085 --> 00:20:10,181
-What's going on?
-It's just nice when we're together.

277
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:13,881
It's nicer when everyone
gets to wear underwear.

278
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:26,297
Please, guys, we have to talk.

279
00:20:26,506 --> 00:20:29,236
Wait! I'm getting a déjà vu.

280
00:20:29,442 --> 00:20:30,568
No, I'm not.

281
00:20:33,346 --> 00:20:36,315
-We have to talk.
-There it is!

282
00:20:39,018 --> 00:20:40,815
Okay, it's about Alan.

283
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:45,480
Speaking of which, tell him
we're on for the Renaissance Fair.

284
00:20:45,758 --> 00:20:50,024
Before you get into that,
there's something you should know.

285
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:54,464
There's really no easy way
to say this.

286
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:59,033
I've decided to break up with Alan.

287
00:21:02,642 --> 00:21:05,304
Is there somebody else?

288
00:21:07,213 --> 00:21:09,113
No, it's just...

289
00:21:09,315 --> 00:21:12,250
...you know, things change.
People change.

290
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:14,817
We didn't change.

291
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:20,184
So that's it? It's over?

292
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:22,719
Just like that?

293
00:21:23,863 --> 00:21:28,994
You let your guard down. You start
to care about someone, and...

294
00:21:32,138 --> 00:21:34,299
-I can go on pretending...
-Okay!

295
00:21:34,507 --> 00:21:35,565
No.

296
00:21:35,775 --> 00:21:38,903
That wouldn't be fair to me, Alan,
or to you.

297
00:21:39,111 --> 00:21:41,102
Well, who wants fair?

298
00:21:41,314 --> 00:21:45,512
I just want things back, you know,
the way they were.

299
00:21:47,486 --> 00:21:51,684
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, she's sorry. I feel better.

300
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:54,483
I can't believe this!

301
00:21:54,694 --> 00:21:59,757
With the holidays coming up.
I wanted him to meet my family.

302
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,501
I'll meet someone.
There'll be other Alans.

303
00:22:03,703 --> 00:22:04,863
Yeah, right!

304
00:22:09,709 --> 00:22:13,270
-Are you guys gonna be okay?
-We'll be fine.

305
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:16,073
We're just gonna need a little time.

306
00:22:17,016 --> 00:22:19,211
I understand.

307
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:26,357
-Wow.
-I'm really sorry.

308
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,687
Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry too.

309
00:22:29,895 --> 00:22:33,228
-But I'm a little relieved.
-Relieved?

310
00:22:33,432 --> 00:22:37,095
Yeah, well, I mean,
I had a great time with you.

311
00:22:37,637 --> 00:22:40,538
I just can't stand your friends.

312
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:50,145
Remember when we went to Central Park
and rented boats?

313
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:53,979
That was fun.

314
00:22:55,021 --> 00:22:57,956
He could row like a Viking.

315
00:23:06,332 --> 00:23:08,698
So how'd it go?

316
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:10,930
You know.

317
00:23:11,137 --> 00:23:13,537
Did he mention us?

318
00:23:17,543 --> 00:23:20,740
He says he's really gonna
miss you guys.

319
00:23:26,952 --> 00:23:29,477
-Rough day, huh?
-You have no idea.

320
00:23:29,689 --> 00:23:31,589
Come here.

321
00:23:34,593 --> 00:23:37,118
-That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
-No!

322
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,628
I don't care! I'm weak!

323
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:41,732
I've gotta have the smoke!

324
00:23:41,934 --> 00:23:45,631
If you never smoke again,
I'll give you $7000.

325
00:23:45,838 --> 00:23:47,669
Yeah, all right.
