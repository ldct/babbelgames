1
00:00:01,895 --> 00:00:03,328
You don't understand.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,556
For us, kissing is as
important as any part.

3
00:00:06,767 --> 00:00:08,234
Yeah, right!

4
00:00:11,224 --> 00:00:12,417
You serious?

5
00:00:13,107 --> 00:00:14,096
Oh, yeah.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,992
-Everything is in that first kiss.

6
00:00:17,196 --> 00:00:18,094
-Absolutely.

7
00:00:17,978 --> 00:00:20,538
For us, kissing's an opening act...

8
00:00:20,748 --> 00:00:23,876
...like the comedian
you have to sit through...

9
00:00:24,084 --> 00:00:26,109
...before Pink Floyd comes out.

10
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,621
And it's not that
we don't like the comedian.

11
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,991
It's just that that's not
why we bought the ticket.

12
00:00:39,767 --> 00:00:44,033
The problem is, no matter
how great the show was...

13
00:00:44,271 --> 00:00:47,763
...you girls are looking
for the comedian again.

14
00:00:48,042 --> 00:00:52,911
We're in the car, fighting traffic,
just trying to stay awake.

15
00:00:54,915 --> 00:00:57,816
Word of advice:
Bring back the comedian.

16
00:00:58,052 --> 00:01:02,682
Or next time you'll find yourself
listening to that album alone.

17
00:01:07,394 --> 00:01:09,828
Are we still talking about sex?

18
00:01:11,164 --> 00:01:13,257
The One With the Sonogram at the End

19
00:02:01,315 --> 00:02:03,249
No, it's good. It is good.

20
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,079
It's just that... Doesn't she seem
a little angry?

21
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,072
Well, she has issues.

22
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:11,002
Does she?

23
00:02:11,758 --> 00:02:14,283
Try to live with "Mr. I'm Evolving."

24
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:21,558
He's out while she's home getting
the mastodon smell out of the carpet.

25
00:02:22,035 --> 00:02:25,129
Marsha, see, these are cave people.

26
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,335
Okay, they have issues like:

27
00:02:28,809 --> 00:02:32,176
"Gee, that glacier's
getting kind of close."

28
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:35,712
Speaking of issues,
isn't that your ex-wife?

29
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,747
-No.
-Yes, it is. Carol, hi!

30
00:02:38,018 --> 00:02:42,114
Okay. Yes, it is.
I'll catch up with you in the Ice Age.

31
00:02:42,322 --> 00:02:44,051
-Can I stay?
-No.

32
00:02:58,705 --> 00:03:00,400
-Hi.
-Hi.

33
00:03:08,115 --> 00:03:10,879
-Is this a bad time?
-No, it's...

34
00:03:11,084 --> 00:03:13,314
...the Stone Age.

35
00:03:15,522 --> 00:03:19,322
You look great. I hate that.

36
00:03:20,227 --> 00:03:23,628
Sorry. Thanks. You look good too.

37
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,458
Well, you know,
in here, anyone who...

38
00:03:28,235 --> 00:03:29,566
...stands erect...

39
00:03:32,906 --> 00:03:35,807
-What's new? Still a...
-A lesbian?

40
00:03:37,711 --> 00:03:41,442
You never know. How's the family?

41
00:03:41,882 --> 00:03:46,876
-Marty's still totally paranoid.
-Carol, why are you here?

42
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:51,419
-I'm pregnant.
-Pregnant.

43
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:02,467
<i>She didn't leave
in such a hurry after all.</i>

44
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:07,368
This is the <i>Three's Company</i> episode
with a misunderstanding.

45
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,077
Then I've already seen this one.

46
00:04:14,181 --> 00:04:15,876
Are you through with that?

47
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,845
Sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.

48
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,017
Whose ball of paper is this?

49
00:04:22,256 --> 00:04:26,158
Mine. I wrote a note to myself,
then I didn't need it.

50
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,386
So I balled it up
and now I wish I was dead.

51
00:04:30,931 --> 00:04:35,959
She already fluffed that pillow.
You already fluffed... It's fine.

52
00:04:36,436 --> 00:04:40,099
I just don't wanna give them
any more ammunition.

53
00:04:40,307 --> 00:04:44,437
Parents can be cruel about
the flatness of a child's pillow.

54
00:04:46,179 --> 00:04:49,512
Relax, you do this every time.
The place looks great.

55
00:04:49,716 --> 00:04:53,208
You got a lasagna here
that looks good enough...

56
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,081
...to avoid touching.

57
00:04:58,425 --> 00:04:59,687
Monica? Hi!

58
00:05:01,561 --> 00:05:04,029
Monica, you're scaring me.

59
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:08,732
I mean, you're all chaotic
and twirly, you know?

60
00:05:09,202 --> 00:05:10,362
Not in a good way.

61
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:18,075
Calm down. You don't see Ross
getting twirly every time they come.

62
00:05:18,312 --> 00:05:22,043
That's because my parents think
Ross can do no wrong.

63
00:05:22,249 --> 00:05:24,114
You see, he's "The Prince."

64
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,843
They had some big ceremony
before I was born.

65
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,154
-What?
-Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.

66
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:42,602
-Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
-It's beautiful.

67
00:05:47,507 --> 00:05:50,738
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

68
00:05:50,944 --> 00:05:52,741
No, don't touch that.

69
00:05:55,148 --> 00:05:59,551
Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow
enough, having to give it back.

70
00:05:59,753 --> 00:06:04,850
"Hi, Barry, remember me? I'm the girl
that stomped on your heart."

71
00:06:05,058 --> 00:06:08,289
Now I must return the ring
without the ring...

72
00:06:08,495 --> 00:06:11,430
...which makes it so much harder.

73
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:15,045
Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we?

74
00:06:15,402 --> 00:06:18,428
Look, it's gonna be okay.
You'll give it back...

75
00:06:18,638 --> 00:06:22,699
and we'll eat ice cream.
Okay, it's a pear-shaped diamond

76
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:26,072
Any diamond ring we find,
we'll run it by you.

77
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:32,250
-When did you have it last?
-Doy, right before she lost it.

78
00:06:34,721 --> 00:06:37,349
You don't get
a lot of "doy" these days.

79
00:06:39,192 --> 00:06:41,558
I know I had it this morning.

80
00:06:41,762 --> 00:06:44,890
I know I had it when I was
in the kitchen with...

81
00:06:45,198 --> 00:06:46,529
Dinah?

82
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:52,927
-Oh, don't be mad.
-You didn't.

83
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,406
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-I gave you one job!

84
00:06:58,745 --> 00:07:01,339
But look how straight
those noodles are.

85
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:06,745
That's not how you look
for an engagement ring in a lasagna.

86
00:07:09,942 --> 00:07:11,410
I just can't do it.

87
00:07:11,992 --> 00:07:15,553
Boys? We're going in.

88
00:07:24,004 --> 00:07:24,993
Hi.

89
00:07:26,907 --> 00:07:30,308
-That is not a happy "hi."
-Carol's pregnant.

90
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,977
I found it!

91
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:37,410
What?

92
00:07:37,784 --> 00:07:39,012
Yeah.

93
00:07:40,053 --> 00:07:44,683
Do that for two hours, you might
be where I am about now.

94
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:48,856
That puts that whole
pillow thing in perspective.

95
00:07:51,198 --> 00:07:53,666
How do you fit into this whole thing?

96
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:56,595
Carol and Susan want me
to be involved.

97
00:07:56,803 --> 00:08:01,399
But if I'm not comfortable with it,
I don't have to be involved.

98
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:05,975
-It's totally up to me.
-She is so great. I miss her.

99
00:08:11,084 --> 00:08:15,418
-What does she mean by "involved"?
-Your job is done.

100
00:08:17,557 --> 00:08:19,286
And the most enjoyable.

101
00:08:21,228 --> 00:08:23,128
Phoebe, say something.

102
00:08:23,363 --> 00:08:26,696
They want me to go down
to this sonogram thing...

103
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,527
...with them tomorrow.

104
00:08:28,735 --> 00:08:30,862
Remember when life was simpler...

105
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:33,505
...and she was just a lesbian?

106
00:08:34,674 --> 00:08:37,074
Those were the days.

107
00:08:37,577 --> 00:08:41,172
-What are you gonna do?
-I have no idea.

108
00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:45,147
No matter what I do,
I'm still gonna be a father.

109
00:08:55,095 --> 00:08:57,325
This is still ruined, right?

110
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:06,570
Martha Lugwin's daughter
is gonna call you.

111
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:13,005
-What's that curry taste?
-Curry.

112
00:09:17,317 --> 00:09:20,377
I think they're great. I really do.

113
00:09:20,654 --> 00:09:23,714
The big Lugwin had a thing for you.

114
00:09:23,924 --> 00:09:27,416
-They all had a thing for him.

115
00:09:27,694 --> 00:09:29,924
Why is this girl going to call me?

116
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:36,000
She just graduated, and she wants
to be something in cooking or food...

117
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,500
I told her you had a restaurant...

12
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,200
-I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.

13
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,300
-They don't have to know that.

119
00:09:47,447 --> 00:09:51,042
-Ross, help me with the spaghetti.
-Yes.

120
00:09:51,251 --> 00:09:54,948
Oh, we're having spaghetti.
That's easy.

121
00:09:56,122 --> 00:09:58,056
We were going to have lasagna.

122
00:09:58,258 --> 00:10:01,125
-I love lasagna.
-We're not having it.

123
00:10:02,128 --> 00:10:05,222
Then why bring it up? He latches on.

124
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:10,165
This will sound unbelievably selfish...

125
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,136
...but did you plan to bring
up the baby/lesbian thing?

126
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:16,866
It might take the heat off of me.

127
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,677
That Rachel.
We saw her parents at the club.

128
00:10:23,883 --> 00:10:25,976
They were not playing well.

129
00:10:26,186 --> 00:10:28,381
I won't say what they spent...

130
00:10:28,655 --> 00:10:31,146
...but $40,000 is a lot for a wedding.

131
00:10:34,094 --> 00:10:37,996
At least she had the chance
to leave a man at the altar.

132
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:43,903
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Nothing.

133
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,262
-It's an expression.
-No, it's not.

134
00:10:47,474 --> 00:10:50,773
Don't listen to her.
You've always been independent.

135
00:10:51,077 --> 00:10:53,409
Even when you were a chubby kid...

136
00:10:53,613 --> 00:10:56,741
...and you had no friends,
you were just fine.

137
00:10:58,251 --> 00:11:01,379
You'd read alone in your room.
Your puzzles...

138
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:08,892
People like Ross need
to shoot for the stars.

139
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:11,962
With his museum
and his published papers.

140
00:11:12,198 --> 00:11:15,599
Others are satisfied with
staying where they are.

141
00:11:15,802 --> 00:11:18,236
These people never get cancer.

142
00:11:19,372 --> 00:11:22,432
They're happy with what
they have, content...

143
00:11:22,642 --> 00:11:24,667
...like cows.

144
00:11:26,513 --> 00:11:27,946
Cows, Dad?

145
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:31,245
She knows how much I love cows.

146
00:11:33,753 --> 00:11:37,849
I read about women trying
to have it all, and I thank God...

147
00:11:38,124 --> 00:11:41,116
...our "Harmonica"
doesn't have that problem.

148
00:11:42,662 --> 00:11:47,292
-I'm telling you, you'll be fine.
-Thank you, Daddy.

149
00:11:48,268 --> 00:11:51,499
Oh, so this does work.

150
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:57,135
So, Ross, what's going on with you?

151
00:11:58,244 --> 00:12:03,045
Any stories? No news, no little
anecdotes to share with the folks?

152
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:09,920
Look, I realize you guys
have been wondering...

153
00:12:10,156 --> 00:12:13,216
...what exactly happened
between Carol and me.

154
00:12:13,426 --> 00:12:16,190
And so, well, here's the deal.

155
00:12:18,231 --> 00:12:19,664
Carol's a lesbian.

156
00:12:21,868 --> 00:12:24,166
She lives with a woman named Susan.

157
00:12:26,072 --> 00:12:28,768
She's pregnant with my child.

158
00:12:29,776 --> 00:12:32,768
She and Susan are
going to raise the baby.

159
00:12:36,883 --> 00:12:38,441
And you knew about this?

160
00:12:46,593 --> 00:12:48,254
Folks are really that bad?

161
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:52,023
Well, you know, these people are pros.

162
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:55,724
They know what they do.

163
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,962
They take their time.
They get the job done.

164
00:13:01,508 --> 00:13:04,636
They say that you can't change
your parents.

165
00:13:04,911 --> 00:13:08,039
Boy, if you could, I'd want yours.

166
00:13:09,849 --> 00:13:10,838
Must pee.

167
00:13:12,552 --> 00:13:14,452
It's worse when you're twins.

168
00:13:14,654 --> 00:13:16,645
-You're a twin?
-We don't speak.

169
00:13:16,856 --> 00:13:19,848
She's this high-powered,
driven, career-type.

170
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:22,892
-What does she do?
-She's a waitress.

171
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,790
-Identical?
-People say we look alike.

172
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,365
But I don't see it.

173
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:32,495
You guys, I kind of
gotta clean up now.

174
00:13:32,705 --> 00:13:35,606
Chandler, as an only child,
you don't have this.

175
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:39,142
No, although I did have
an imaginary friend...

176
00:13:39,412 --> 00:13:41,209
...who my parents preferred.

177
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:45,576
Hit the lights, please.

178
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:54,556
How long was I in there?

179
00:13:55,628 --> 00:14:00,156
-I'm just cleaning up.
-Oh, you need any help?

180
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:03,425
Okay, sure. Thanks.

181
00:14:09,142 --> 00:14:10,166
Anyway...

182
00:14:11,277 --> 00:14:14,440
So you nervous
about Barry tomorrow?

183
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:16,346
A little.

184
00:14:18,184 --> 00:14:19,515
A lot.

185
00:14:20,787 --> 00:14:23,278
So, got any advice?

186
00:14:23,523 --> 00:14:26,720
You know, as someone
who's recently been dumped.

187
00:14:27,861 --> 00:14:31,422
You may wanna steer clear
of the word "dumped."

188
00:14:32,765 --> 00:14:36,963
Chances are he's gonna be
this broken shell of a man.

189
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:42,505
You should try not to look
too terrific. I know it'll be hard.

190
00:14:44,711 --> 00:14:49,045
Or I'll go down there,
and I'll give Barry back his ring.

191
00:14:49,315 --> 00:14:53,911
And you can go with Carol
and Susan to the ob-gyn.

192
00:14:55,822 --> 00:14:58,313
You've got Carol tomorrow.

193
00:14:59,158 --> 00:15:02,787
-When did it get so complicated?
-Got me.

194
00:15:03,496 --> 00:15:06,124
-Remember being in high school?

195
00:15:06,332 --> 00:15:08,892
Didn't you think you'd meet someone...

196
00:15:09,102 --> 00:15:11,502
...fall in love, and that'd be it?

197
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,874
-Ross?
-Yes. Yes.

198
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:25,283
Man, I never thought I'd be here.

199
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,500
Me neither.

200
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,942
Sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work.

201
00:15:53,146 --> 00:15:56,741
There was this big
dinosaur thing. Anyway...

202
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:58,406
Hi.

203
00:15:59,686 --> 00:16:02,883
-You remember Susan.
-How could I forget?

204
00:16:04,223 --> 00:16:06,851
Hello, Susan.
Good shake, good shake.

205
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:11,726
So, we're just waiting for...?

206
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:14,263
-Dr. Oberman.
-And is he...?

207
00:16:14,467 --> 00:16:16,435
-She.
-Of course, "she."

208
00:16:18,137 --> 00:16:22,130
Is she familiar with our
special situation?

209
00:16:22,408 --> 00:16:26,504
-Yes, and she's very supportive.
-Okay, that's great.

210
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:29,241
No, I'm... Oh.

211
00:16:30,683 --> 00:16:32,014
Thanks.

212
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:53,900
That opens my cervix.

213
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,614
-Barry?
-Come on in.

214
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:05,474
-Are you sure?
-It's fine.

215
00:17:05,685 --> 00:17:07,880
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

216
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,400
So, how ya doin?

218
00:17:16,796 --> 00:17:18,195
I'm...I'm okay.

109
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,100
-You look great.

219
00:17:19,499 --> 00:17:22,161
-Yeah, well.

220
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:25,337
<i>Dr. Farber, Jason Greenspan's gagging.</i>

221
00:17:25,571 --> 00:17:28,404
Be right there. Be back in a second.

222
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,374
I dumped him.

223
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:56,930
So, how's this all gonna work?

224
00:17:57,136 --> 00:17:59,934
The baby grows
in a special place inside...

225
00:18:00,173 --> 00:18:01,162
Thank you.

226
00:18:01,374 --> 00:18:05,538
I mean, how's this gonna work,
you know, with us?

227
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:08,847
When important decisions
have to be made?

228
00:18:09,215 --> 00:18:12,514
-Give me a "for instance."
-Well, I don't know.

229
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:16,154
-How about with the baby's name?
-Marlon.

230
00:18:16,355 --> 00:18:18,949
If it's a boy. Minnie, if it's a girl.

231
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,652
As in "Mouse"?

232
00:18:24,197 --> 00:18:25,528
As in my grandmother.

233
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:29,527
Still, you say "Minnie,"
you hear "Mouse."

234
00:18:31,537 --> 00:18:33,198
How about...?

235
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:35,172
How about Julia?

236
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
-Julia.
-We agreed on Minnie.

237
00:18:38,778 --> 00:18:41,440
We agreed we'd spend
our lives together.

238
00:18:41,681 --> 00:18:44,343
Things change.
Roll with the punches.

239
00:18:45,084 --> 00:18:47,052
I believe Julia's on the table?

240
00:18:50,022 --> 00:18:51,546
Sorry about that.

241
00:18:54,594 --> 00:18:57,154
So, what have you been up to?

242
00:18:57,363 --> 00:18:59,763
Oh, not much.

243
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:02,867
-I got a job.
-That's great.

244
00:19:04,203 --> 00:19:05,727
Why are you so tan?

245
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,676
I went to Aruba.

246
00:19:10,877 --> 00:19:13,607
Oh, no. You went
on our honeymoon alone?

247
00:19:13,913 --> 00:19:14,971
No.

248
00:19:18,484 --> 00:19:20,179
I went with...

249
00:19:21,654 --> 00:19:23,383
-Now, this may hurt.
-Me?

250
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:24,681
No.

251
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:28,753
I went with Mindy.

252
00:19:29,462 --> 00:19:30,588
Mindy?

253
00:19:31,664 --> 00:19:33,325
My maid of honor, Mindy?

254
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,500
Yeah, we're kind of a thing now.

255
00:19:40,907 --> 00:19:42,738
You got plugs!

256
00:19:42,942 --> 00:19:45,809
Careful. They haven't quite taken yet.

257
00:19:46,212 --> 00:19:48,043
And you got lenses.

258
00:19:48,848 --> 00:19:51,783
You hate sticking your finger
in your eye.

259
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:53,451
Not for her.

260
00:19:57,323 --> 00:19:59,814
Listen, I really wanted to thank you.

261
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:01,892
Okay.

262
00:20:02,695 --> 00:20:07,530
A month ago, I wanted to hurt you
more than I've ever wanted to.

263
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:09,724
And I'm an orthodontist.

264
00:20:11,637 --> 00:20:15,164
You know, you were right.
I thought we were happy.

265
00:20:15,408 --> 00:20:17,239
We weren't happy.

266
00:20:18,044 --> 00:20:20,012
But with Mindy...

267
00:20:20,746 --> 00:20:22,577
...now I'm happy.

268
00:20:23,816 --> 00:20:25,078
-Spit.
-What?

269
00:20:25,284 --> 00:20:26,751
Me.

270
00:20:29,255 --> 00:20:30,620
Anyway...

271
00:20:31,891 --> 00:20:36,954
I guess this belongs to you.
Or maybe some day Mindy.

272
00:20:37,163 --> 00:20:39,563
Like she'd settle for that.

273
00:20:43,736 --> 00:20:45,966
Yeah, that's true.

274
00:20:46,172 --> 00:20:49,869
But I think it's a nice ring...

275
00:20:50,076 --> 00:20:53,944
...and thank you for giving it to me.

276
00:20:54,747 --> 00:20:57,113
Thank you for giving it back.

277
00:20:59,452 --> 00:21:00,851
Hello!

278
00:21:04,457 --> 00:21:07,893
-Please, what's wrong with Helen?
-Helen Geller?

279
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:12,720
-I don't think so.
-It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

280
00:21:12,932 --> 00:21:16,163
-Thank you.
-No, I mean, it's not Geller.

281
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:18,536
It'll be Helen Willick?

282
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:24,202
No, actually, we talked about
Helen Willick Bunch.

283
00:21:25,578 --> 00:21:28,240
Wait a minute.
Why is she in the title?

284
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,500
It's my baby too.

285
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:33,279
Really? I don't remember
you making any sperm.

286
00:21:36,022 --> 00:21:38,650
And we all know what
a challenge that is.

170
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,000
-You two, stop it.

171
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,900
No! She gets a credit, I'm in there too.

288
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:49,163
Helen Willick Bunch Geller?
I think that borders on child abuse.

289
00:21:49,402 --> 00:21:53,236
Of course not.
I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.

290
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:57,842
See what he does? He knows no one's
gonna say all those names.

291
00:21:58,077 --> 00:22:00,602
They'll call her Geller.
He gets his way.

292
00:22:00,813 --> 00:22:02,906
My way? You think this is my way?

293
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:06,710
Of all the ways I ever imagined
this moment being...

294
00:22:06,986 --> 00:22:10,581
...this is not my... You know what?
This is too hard.

295
00:22:10,823 --> 00:22:13,519
Knock, knock. How are we? Any nausea?

296
00:22:13,726 --> 00:22:15,626
-A little.
-Just a little.

297
00:22:17,363 --> 00:22:22,232
I was wondering about the
mother-to-be, but thanks for sharing.

298
00:22:22,468 --> 00:22:25,926
-Lie back.
-You know what? I'm gonna go.

299
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:30,507
I don't think I can be involved
in this family thing.

300
00:22:41,354 --> 00:22:44,050
-Oh, my God!
-Look at that.

301
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,757
I know.

302
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:58,329
Well, isn't that amazing?

303
00:23:01,774 --> 00:23:04,174
What are we supposed to be
seeing here?

304
00:23:05,277 --> 00:23:09,907
I don't know, but I think it's about
to attack the Enterprise.

305
00:23:13,219 --> 00:23:16,154
If you tilt your head
and relax your eyes...

306
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:19,222
...it kind of looks
like an old potato.

307
00:23:19,892 --> 00:23:22,326
Then don't do that, all right?

308
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:27,222
Monica, what do you think?

309
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:32,196
-Are you welling up?
-No.

310
00:23:32,405 --> 00:23:35,704
-You are. You're welling up.
-I'm not.

311
00:23:35,908 --> 00:23:38,468
-You're gonna be an aunt.
-Oh, shut up.

312
00:23:39,979 --> 00:23:43,847
Hi, Mindy. Hi, it's Rachel.

313
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:47,815
Yeah, I'm fine. I saw Barry today.

314
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,684
Yeah, he told me. No, it's okay.
Really, it's okay.

315
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:56,450
I hope you two are very happy.
I really do.

316
00:23:56,796 --> 00:24:00,425
And, Min, you know,
if everything works out...

317
00:24:00,633 --> 00:24:04,364
...and you guys get married
and have kids...

318
00:24:04,603 --> 00:24:07,731
...I hope they have his hairline
and your nose!

319
00:24:12,778 --> 00:24:16,805
That was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now!
