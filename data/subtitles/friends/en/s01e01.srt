2
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,268
There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

3
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,603
Come on, you're going out with the guy.

4
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,398
There's gotta be something
wrong with him.

5
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,650
All right, Joey.
Be nice.

6
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,361
So does he have a hump, a hump and a hairpiece?

7
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,615
Wait, does he eat chalk?

8
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:17,077
I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl

9
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:21,331
Okay, everybody relax.
This is not even a date.

10
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:25,878
It's just two people going out
to dinner and not having sex.

11
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:29,214
Sounds like a date to me.

12
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,510
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria

13
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:36,889
and I realize I'm totally naked.

14
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,765
Oh, yeah. Had that dream.

15
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:42,769
Then I look down and I realize
there's a phone...

16
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,200
there.

17
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,693
- Instead of...
- That's right!

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,300
Never had that dream.

19
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:56,200
All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

20
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:59,411
Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.

21
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,164
They weren't looking at you before?

22
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:06,919
Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it.

23
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,923
And it turns out it's my mother.

24
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:15,093
Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

25
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,601
Hi.

26
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,481
This guy says hello,
I want to kill myself.

27
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,650
You okay sweetie?

28
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:35,197
I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth...

29
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:39,868
- and tied it around my neck.
- Cookie?

30
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
Carol moved her stuff out today.

33
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,600
[UNCUT] Ohh

31
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,200
- Let me get you some coffee.
- Thanks.

32
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:54,883
No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,300
Just leave my aura alone, okay?

37
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,900
- Fine, be murky.

34
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:03,684
I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.

39
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,400
- No, you don't.

35
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:07,271
No, I don't.
To hell with her. She left me!

36
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,232
You never knew she was a lesbian?

37
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,571
No! Okay?

38
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,782
Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

39
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:23,912
She didn't know.
How should I know?

40
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:28,917
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

41
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,670
Did I say that out loud?

42
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:37,759
I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.

43
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:38,927
Oh, really?

44
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,764
So that hysterical phone call
I got from a woman sobbing..

45
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:47,603
"I'll never have grandchildren,"

50
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
was what? A wrong number?

46
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,100
Sorry.

47
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,858
Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now.

48
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,694
You're angry.
You're hurting.

49
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,113
Can I tell you what
the answer is?

50
00:03:58,322 --> 00:03:59,615
Strip joint!

51
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,161
C'mon, you're single.
Have some hormones.

52
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,539
I don't want
to be single, okay?

53
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:11,293
I just want to be married again.

54
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:19,092
And I just want a million dollars!

60
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,000
Rachel ?

61
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,000
- Oh god, Monica! Thank God!

62
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,500
I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer

63
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,700
said you might be here and you are, you are!

58
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:36,693
- Can I get you some coffee?
- Decaf.

59
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,739
Everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

60
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,534
This is everybody.
This is Chandler and Phoebe..

61
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,911
Joey.
Remember my brother, Ross?

62
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,329
Sure!

63
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:01,885
You want to tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

64
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:07,891
Well, it started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

65
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,769
i was in this room where we were keeping all the presents

72
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,900
and I was looking at this gravy boat.

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,400
This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat.

74
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,000
When all of a sudden
Sweet 'N Low?

69
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:26,201
I realized I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than Barry.

70
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,246
I got freaked out,
and it hit me:

71
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,249
How much Barry looks
like Mr. Potato Head.

72
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,378
I always knew
he looked familiar, but..

73
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,900
I had to get out of there,
and I started wondering..

74
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,013
"Why am I doing this,"
and "Who am I doing it for?"

82
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,700
So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart,

83
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,300
but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.

84
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,000
- Who wasn't invited to the wedding.

85
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,500
I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...

86
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,700
I guess he bought her the pipe organ,

87
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,400
and she's really not happy about it.

88
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,700
Tuna or egg salad!
Decide!

80
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:30,015
 I'll have whatever Christine is having.

81
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:33,519
Daddy, I just
I can't marry him.

91
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,500
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,800
I just don't love him.

83
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,200
Well, it matters to me!

84
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:50,285
"If I let go of my hair,
my head will fall off."

85
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:54,790
She should not be
wearing those pants.

96
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,000
Push her down the stairs!

97
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,100
Push her!
Push her down the stairs!

88
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,969
Come on, Daddy, listen to me!

89
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:11,807
It's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, "You're a shoe!"

90
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,434
"You're a shoe!"

91
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,646
What if I don't want to be a shoe?

92
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,899
What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know?

93
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,735
Or a hat?

94
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,488
No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat

95
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,500
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

96
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:34,079
You can see where he'd have trouble.

97
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,708
Look, Daddy,
it's my life.

98
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,671
Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

99
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:48,093
I guess we've established
she's staying here with Monica.

100
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,889
Well, maybe that's my decision.

101
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,308
Maybe I don't need your money.

102
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,000
Wait!
I said maybe!

103
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,779
Just breathe. That's it.

104
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,449
Try to think of nice, calm things.

105
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:14,244
Raindrops on roses
And rabbits and kittens

106
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:18,874
Bluebells and sleighbells
And something with mittens

107
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:23,378
La la la something
And noodles with string

108
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:25,672
I'm all better now.

109
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,700
I helped.

110
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,722
This is probably for the best.

121
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,800
Independence. Taking control of your life.

122
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,800
The whole hat thing.

112
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:43,440
And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey.

113
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:47,236
Me and Chandler live across the hall.
He's away a lot.

114
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:51,740
Stop hitting on her!
It's her wedding day.

115
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,244
Like there's a rule, or something?

117
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:03,418
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.

118
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,254
It's Paul.

119
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,924
Oh, God, is it 6:30?
Buzz him in.

120
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,593
- Who's Paul?
- Paul, the wine guy?

121
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,000
Maybe.

122
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,265
Your "not a real date" toinght
is with Paul, the wine guy?

123
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,934
- He finally asked you out?
- Yes!

124
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,645
This is a "Dear Diary" moment.

136
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,800
- Rach, wait, I can cancel.

137
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,500
- Please, no, go, that'd be fine.

126
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:30,070
Ross, are you okay?
Do you want me to stay?

127
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,500
That'd be good.

128
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:38,203
- Really?- Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy!

141
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,900
What does that mean?
Does he sell it? drink it? or just complain a lot?

131
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:46,503
Hi, come in!
Paul, this is..

132
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:50,257
everybody.
Everybody, this is Paul.

133
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:55,804
- The wine guy.
- I didn't catch your name. Paul?

134
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,642
I'll be right back.
I just gotta go

135
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:03,187
A-wandering?

136
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,730
Change.

137
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,357
Sit down.
Two seconds.

138
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,574
I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.

139
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,747
Hey, Paul, here's a tip.

140
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:26,502
She really likes it when you
rub her neck in the same spot..

141
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,546
until it starts to get a little red.

142
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,600
Shut up, Joey!

143
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,719
What are you up to tonight?

144
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:40,224
I was kinda supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon..

145
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,100
so, nothing.

146
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:47,272
Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

147
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,400
Although, Aruba.
This time of year?

148
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,945
Talk about your..

149
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,600
big lizards.

150
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:01,954
If you don't feel like being
alone tonight..

151
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,707
Joey and Chandler are coming over to
help me put together my new furniture.

152
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,293
We're very excited about it.

153
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:11,713
Thanks. But I think I'm just
going to hang out here tonight.

154
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,007
- It's been kinda a long day.

155
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,000
Pheebs, you wanna help?

156
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,721
I wish I could,
but I don't want to.

168
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,900
Love is sweet as summer showers

169
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,200
Love is a wondrous work of art

158
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:39,658
But your love
Oh, your love, your love

159
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:44,288
Is like a giant pigeon

160
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:48,125
Crapping on my heart

161
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,500
Thank you.

162
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,309
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things..

163
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:08,312
using a bunch of these
little worm guys.

164
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:14,318
I have no brackety thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever..

165
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:17,321
and I cannot feel my legs.

166
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:24,536
- We've got a bookcase.
- It's beautiful.

167
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,455
What's this?

168
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:31,668
I would have to say
that is an L-shaped bracket.

169
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:36,131
- Which goes where?
- I have no idea.

170
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,303
- Done with the bookcase.
- All finished.

171
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:47,684
This was Carol's favorite beer.

172
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:52,523
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.

186
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,500
If you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.

187
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,100
- Please don't spoil all this fun.

174
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,400
Ross, let me ask you a question.

175
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:07,329
She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

176
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:09,331
What did you get?

191
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,600
- You guys.

192
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,300
- You got screwed.
- Oh, my God.

178
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:17,422
- Oh, my God!
- I know, I'm such an idiot.

179
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:22,177
I should've known when she went to
the dentist five times a week.

180
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,721
I mean, how clean can teeth get?

181
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,266
My brother's going through that.
He's such a mess.

182
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,017
How did you get through it?

183
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:32,729
Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers

184
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,523
- Say her...
- Leg?

200
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,800
That's one way.

201
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,100
I went for the watch.

186
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:41,822
You actually broke her watch?

203
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,900
The worst I ever did was shred

204
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,800
my old boyfriend's favorite towel.

188
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:50,038
- Steer clear of you.
- That's right.

189
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:53,584
Barry, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

190
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:59,256
You probably think it's about making
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

191
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,217
It's about me.
And I just

192
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,810
The machine cut me off again.
Anyway..

193
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:21,653
I know that some lucky girl is going
to become Mrs. Barry Finkel.

194
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:25,574
But it isn't me.
It's not me.

195
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:30,245
Not that I have any idea who "me" is
right now, but you just

196
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,249
I'm divorced.

214
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,900
- I'm only 26, and I'm divorced!

215
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,400
- Shut up!

216
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,700
You must stop!

198
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,638
That only took me an hour.

199
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,853
We haven't had a relationship
that's lasted longer than a Mento.


219
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,500
You have had the love of a woman
for four years.

220
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,900
Four years of closeness and sharing,

221
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,800
after which she ripped your heart out.
That is why we don't do it!

222
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,600
I don't think that was my point!

204
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:17,334
Know what's scary? What if there's
only one woman for everybody?

205
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:20,671
I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

206
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,843
Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

207
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:31,098
What are you talking about?
One woman.

208
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:35,310
That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream.

209
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:39,648
Let me tell you something.
There's lots of flavors out there.

210
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:43,902
Rocky road and cookie dough
and bing cherry vanilla.

211
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:49,032
You can get them with jimmies
or nuts or whipped cream.

212
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:52,077
It's the best thing
to happen to you!

213
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:56,123
You got married.
You were like, what, 8?

214
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,919
Welcome back to the world.
Grab a spoon!

234
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,000
- I don't know if I'm hungry or horny.

235
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,800
- Stay out of my freezer.

216
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,806
Ever since she walked out on me..

217
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,100
What?

218
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:17,895
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

219
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:22,816
It's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.

220
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:27,529
So there's going to be
a fifth date?

221
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,323
Isn't there?

222
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,742
Yeah, yeah.
I think there is.

223
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,700
What were you going to say?

224
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,378
Ever since she left me..

225
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:46,381
I haven't been able to perform..

226
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:47,900
sexually.

247
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,500
Oh, God!

248
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,700
I'm so sorry.

228
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:58,727
Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.

229
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,730
How long?

230
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,000
- Two years.
- Wow.

231
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:09,112
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

232
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:14,993
So you still think you might
want that fifth date?

233
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,300
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

234
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:26,088
We are gathered here
to join Joanie Louise Cunningham..

235
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:31,635
and Charles.
Chachi, Chachi, Chachi..

236
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:36,473
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

238
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:43,981
But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.

239
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:46,692
"Grab a spoon."

240
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,237
Do you know how long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

241
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:54,950
Do the words, "Billy, don't be
a hero," mean anything to you?

263
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,800
Great story.

264
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,700
But I gotta go.

265
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,600
I got a date with Andrea.

266
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,800
Angela- Andrea- Oh man.

244
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:10,299
Andrea's the screamer.
Angela has cats.

268
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,700
Right, thanks.

269
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,500
It's Julie.
I'm out of here.

246
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,976
Here's the thing. Even if
I could get it together enough..

247
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,800
to ask a woman out..

248
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:25,689
who am I going to ask?

273
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,200
Isn't this amazing?

274
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,000
I've never made coffee in my life.

250
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,345
- That is amazing.
- Congratulations.

251
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,432
If I can make coffee,
there isn't anything I can't do.

252
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:06,188
I think it's, "If I can invade Poland,
there isn't anything I can't do."

253
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:11,026
If you feel like you have to make
a Western omelet or something..

254
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:17,407
Although, actually
I'm really not that hungry.

255
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:22,079
Oh, good.
Lenny and Squiggy are here.

256
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,623
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

257
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,502
- Morning.
- Morning, Paul.

258
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:31,672
- Hello, Paul.
- Hi. Paul, is it?

259
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,682
- Thank you so much.
- Stop.

260
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,500
Last night was like

261
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,700
all my birthdays, both graduations...
plus the barn-raising scene
in Witness.

262
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,446
We'll talk later.

263
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:02,800
Thank you.

264
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,400
That wasn't a real date.

265
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:17,259
What the hell do you do
on a real date?

266
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:21,263
Shut up and put my table back.

267
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:23,849
I've got to get to work.

268
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:29,563
If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

269
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:35,194
So, like, you guys all have jobs?

295
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Yeah, we all have jobs.

296
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,900
That's how we buy stuff.

297
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,400
- Yeah, I'm an actor.

298
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,700
- Have I seen you in anything?

272
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:49,791
I doubt it.
Mostly regional work.

273
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,462
Unless you saw the Wee One's
production of Pinocchio...

274
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,465
at the little theater
in the park?

275
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:58,217
It was a job!

276
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:01,220
"Look, Geppetto.
I'm a real live boy."

304
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,200
- I will not take this abuse.

305
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,400
- You're right, I'm sorry.

278
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,687
Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy

279
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:17,319
You should both know
that he's a dead man.

280
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:19,488
Oh, Chandler!

281
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:24,201
How are you doing today?
Sleep okay?

282
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:28,330
Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.

283
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
I see that. You look like you
slept with a hanger in your mouth.

284
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:40,843
I know.
He's just so..

285
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:44,096
- Remember you and Tony Demarco?
- Oh, yeah.

286
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:48,016
Well, it's like that.
With feelings.

314
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,800
- Wow, are you in trouble!

315
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,700
- Big time!

288
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:55,649
Want a wedding dress?
Hardly used.

289
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,100
I think we're getting a little
ahead of ourselves.

290
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:04,241
I'm going to get up, go to work,
and not think about him all day.

291
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,078
Or else I'm going to get up
and go to work.

292
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:09,955
- Wish me luck!
- What for?

293
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:14,543
I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

294
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,139
- Hey, Monica.
- Franny, welcome back.

323
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,700
- How was Florida?

324
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,900
- You had sex, didn't you?

325
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
- How do you do that?

326
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
- I hate you.
I'm pushing my aunt through
Parrot Jungle, you're having sex.

298
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:42,362
So, who?

299
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:44,198
You know Paul?

330
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,900
Paul, the wine guy?

331
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,100
Yeah, I know Paul.

301
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:52,915
You mean, you know Paul
like I know Paul?

302
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:55,209
What?
I take credit for Paul.

303
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:59,713
Before me, there was no snap in his
turtle for two years.

304
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:05,552
Of course it was a line.

305
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:08,597
Why would anybody
do something like that?

306
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:12,059
I assume we want an answer
more sophisticated than:

307
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,600
"To get you into bed."

308
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:17,689
I hate men.

340
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,100
Don't hate.

341
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,900
You don't want
to put that out into the universe.

310
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,612
Is it me?

311
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:27,533
Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs..

312
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:30,410
and men with emotional problems
can hear?

313
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,300
Come here.
Give me your feet.

314
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:43,090
I just thought he was nice, you know?

315
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:50,430
I can't believe
you didn't know it was a line.

348
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:54,800
- Guess what?

349
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,100
- You got a job?
Are you kidding?

350
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,900
I'm trained for nothing.

351
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,000
- I was laughed out of 12 interviews.

352
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,800
- You're surprisingly upbeat.

319
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:07,823
You'd be too,
if you found these boots on sale..

320
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,033
50% off.

321
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,287
How well you know me.

322
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:16,957
They're my
"I don't need a job..

323
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,209
I've got great boots" boots.

324
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:22,838
- How did you pay?
- Credit card.

325
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,008
And who pays for that?

326
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,500
My father.

327
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:35,350
Is this really necessary?
I can stop charging any time.

328
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,769
You can't live off your parents.

329
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:41,690
I know that.
That's why I was getting married.

330
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:45,527
Give her a break.
It's hard being on your own.

365
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,100
Thank you.
You're welcome.

332
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:50,449
I remember when I first
came to this city, I was 14.

333
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:53,535
Mom had killed herself,
stepdad was in jail.

334
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:55,746
I didn't know anybody here.

335
00:24:55,954 --> 00:25:00,542
I ended up living with this albino
guy who was cleaning windshields.

336
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:02,544
And then he killed himself.

337
00:25:02,753 --> 00:25:07,424
Then I found aromatherapy.
So I know exactly how you feel.

338
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:13,347
The word you're looking for is:

339
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,100
"Anyway.."

340
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:24,233
- All right, You ready?
- No, how can I be ready?

341
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:27,277
You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?

342
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:29,696
- I can't do this.
- I know you can.

343
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:32,991
- No.
- You made coffee, you can do anything.

344
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:38,497
Cut. Cut. Cut.

345
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,600
You know what?
I think we can leave it at that.
Kind of a symbolic gesture.

346
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,700
- Rachel, that was a library card.

384
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,200
If you listen closely,

385
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,500
you can hear
a thousand retailers scream.

348
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:07,860
Welcome to the real world!

349
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:11,280
It sucks.
You're gonna love it.

388
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,400
That's it.

389
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
Are you going to crash on the couch?

351
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:26,628
- No, I gotta go home sometime.
- Are you gonna be okay?

352
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,600
Look what I just
found on the floor.

353
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,500
What?

393
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,900
That's Paul's watch.

394
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,100
Just put it back where you found it.

355
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:41,977
Oh, boy!
All right.

396
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,700
- Good night, everybody.

397
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,300
- Good night.

357
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,400
- I'm sorry. Have it, I don't want it.
- Split it?

358
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:08,378
You probably didn't know this,
but in high school..

359
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:11,256
I had a major crush on you.

360
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:13,926
I knew.

361
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,300
You did?

362
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:20,974
I figured you thought
I was Monica's geeky brother.

363
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,300
I did.

364
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:29,483
Listen, do you think..?

365
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:34,655
Try not to let my vulnerability
become a factor here.

366
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:39,451
Do you think it would be okay
if I asked you out sometime?

367
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,000
Yeah. Maybe.

370
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,900
Okay. Okay, maybe I will.

411
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,100
- Good night.

412
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:15,800
- Good night.

372
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:16,655
See you.

413
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,200
Wait, wait.

414
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,600
What's with you?

374
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,900
I just grabbed a spoon.

416
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,000
- I can't believe what I'm hearing.

417
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,700
- Can't believe what I'm hearing

376
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:40,053
- What? I said
-  What? I said

419
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,200
- Would you stop?

420
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,000
- Was I doing it again?
- Yes!

421
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,900
I said you had a nice butt.

422
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,100
It's just not a great butt.

423
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,300
- You wouldn't know a butt if it bit you.

424
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,400
- There's an image.

381
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,700
Would anybody like more coffee?

382
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:04,119
You made it,
or you're serving it?

383
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:07,956
- I'm just serving it.
- I'll have a cup of coffee.

428
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,100
Kids, new dream.

429
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,200
I'm in Las Vegas.

386
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,837
Miss, more coffee?

387
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:17,966
Could you give this
to that guy over there?

388
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,303
Go ahead.
Thank you.

389
00:29:21,512 --> 00:29:24,264
Sorry.
Okay, Las Vegas.

390
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:26,558
I'm in Las Vegas.

391
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:29,811
I'm Liza Minelli-
